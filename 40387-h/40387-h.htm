<h3>INTRODUCTORY THOUGHTS,</h3>

</h3>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>The American Unitarian Association in 1835 reprinted
from the English edition, among their Tracts,
a Sermon on "The Existing State of Theology as an
Intellectual Pursuit and of Religion, as a Moral Influence."
Its rare merits elicited great praise. Its
author was the Rev. James Martineau, then a settled
minister in Liverpool. Since that time, his occasional
publications from year to year have been winning a
wider audience, and awakening a deeper admiration.
The history of his mind has been a broadening track
of light. And now the Association feel that they
cannot do a greater favor to the reading public, or
better aid that cause of Liberal Christianity whose
servants they are, than by printing a collection of the
later writings of this gifted man, whom they first introduced
to American Unitarians a quarter of a century
ago.</p>

<p>The list of works prefixed to the article here entitled
"Distinctive Types of Christianity," as it appeared
in the Westminster Review, and the opening sentence
referring to them, have been accidentally omitted.
Two or three of the papers belong to the author's
earlier years, but are inserted here equally on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of their eminent ability, their special timeliness, and
their striking adaptation to the general purpose of the
work; namely, to throw light on the true nature of
Christianity. They will also be new to most of those
whom they now reach. The last paper in the volume
is one of the first its writer published, in his comparative
youth. We shall be disappointed if the benignant
wisdom and moral fidelity of its catholic lessons do not
secure a sympathetic response in many a quarter once
closed against such appeals.</p>

<p>In selecting from Mr. Martineau's numerous invaluable
articles, not already published in book-form, the
contents of the present work, the rule has not been so
much to choose the ablest productions, as to take those
best fitted to meet the wants of the time, by diffusing
among ministers, students of divinity, and the cultivated
laity a knowledge of the most advanced theological
and religious thought yet attained. We regret
that the necessary limits of the volume exclude several
of the author's most instructive and inspiring essays;
particularly the magnificent one in the National Review
upon "Newman, Coleridge, and Carlyle"; also
the one upon "Lessing as a Theologian."</p>

<p>We have called this volume "Studies of Christianity,"
simply as a convenient indication of the general
character of its contents. In justice to the author, it
should be borne in mind that the separate papers were
prepared to meet various occasions, without a suspicion
that they would ever be brought together to form
a book. Of course they do not express his complete
views of the mighty subject which they fragmentarily
treat. The relative order and rank of his convictions,
the interpretation of Christianity from its inner side,
appear much better in his "Endeavors after the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Life,"&mdash;by far the richest and noblest series of
sermons in the English language. Still, a kind of
unity pervades the different pieces composing this collection.
One Christ-like strain of sentiment breathes
through them all. The same consecrating fealty to
truth presides over them all. The same grand outline
of principles and unvarying standard of judgment are
constantly evident. The same marvellous acumen,
breadth of learning, and exquisite culture, everywhere
appear. Each article is more or less directly an illustration
of Christianity, as something moral, spiritual,
vital, dynamic, to be practically assimilated by the soul,
in distinction from the common exposition of it, as
something sacerdotal, dogmatic, formal, forensic, once
enacted and now to be mimetically observed. The
energetic patience of labor, the detersive intellect, the
unalloyed devoutness of spirit, the telescopic range both
of faculty and equipment, revealed even in these wayside
products, awaken in us an unappeasable desire for
a more purposed and systematic work from the same
mind, now in its fullest maturity. In the mean time
we will express our grateful appreciation of the contributions
already furnished, by giving them further
circulation, assured that no truly pious and intelligent
person, free from bigotry and shackles, can peruse them
without receiving equal measures of delight and profit.</p>

<p>Mr. Martineau is so thoroughly acquainted with the
processes and results of spiritual experience, with the
sciences of nature, and with the whole realm of metaphysical
philosophy, and his own wealthy faculties
are so tenacious in their activity and freshness, that
every subject he touches receives novelty, light, and
ornament. He is emphatically a teacher for the
teachers,&mdash;a greater guide and master for the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
guides and masters. Traversing the whole domain of
human contemplation with the defining lines of analysis,
clothing the severe materials of science with the
colors of æsthetic art, he sheds on every theme the illumination
of intellectual genius, and transfuses every
thought with the distinctive sentiments of piety. Thus
is afforded that rarest of all spectacles,&mdash;and the one
now most needed by the cultivated religious world,&mdash;of
a man who is greatly endowed at once as philosopher,
poet, and Christian, and who with simultaneous
earnestness in each capacity is devoted, by the whole
labors of his life, to the instruction of mankind.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we feel it a duty to attract as
much attention as possible to Mr. Martineau's past
and expected publications. The peerless intelligence,
the bracing fidelity, the essential nobleness and catholicity,
the tender beauty and reverence, of his utterances,
his consummate mastery of the great topics he
handles, seem to us fitted in a solitary degree to meet
the highest wants of the age,&mdash;to do divine service in
the conflict of scepticism, sensuality, and decay against
all that is truest and purest in the religious faith and
moral life of Christendom. Therefore, to persons who,
unacquainted with the author's previous works, may
read the papers here collected, we would recommend
as the best books for educated and earnest Christian
thinkers, Mr. Martineau's "Rationale of Religious Inquiry,"
the volume of his "Miscellanies" edited by
the Rev. T. S. King, and the two series of "Endeavors
after the Christian Life" recently republished in
one volume by Messrs. Munroe and Company.</p>

<p>We shall make up the rest of this introductory paper
by quoting from some of Mr. Martineau's articles, not
generally accessible, a few specimens of those thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
which, if freely received in these times of theological
doubt and turmoil, would lead many a religious thinker
towards the truth and peace he covets.</p>

<p>How clearly the following passage shows the true</p>


<h4>RELATION BETWEEN NATURAL AND REVEALED RELIGION.</h4>

<p>The contempt with which it is the frequent practice of
divines to treat the grounds of natural religion, betrays an
ignorance both of the true office of revelation and of the true
wants of the human heart. It cannot be justified, except on
the supposition that there is some contradiction between the
teachings of creation and those of Christ, with some decided
preponderance of proof in favor of the latter. Even if the
Gospel furnished a series of perfectly new truths, of which
nature had been profoundly silent, it would be neither reasonable
nor safe to fix exclusive attention on these recent and historical
acquisitions, and prohibit all reference to those elder
oracles of God, by which his Spirit, enshrined in the glories
of his universe, taught the fathers of our race. And if it be
the function of Christianity not to administer truth entirely
new, but to corroborate by fresh evidence, and invest with
new beauty, and publish to the millions with a voice of power,
a faith latent already in the hearts of many, and scattered
through the speculations of the wise and noble few,&mdash;to
erect into realities the dreams which had visited a half-inspired
philosophy, interpreting the life and lot of man;&mdash;then
there is a relation between the religion of nature and
that of Christ,&mdash;a relation of original and supplement,&mdash;which
renders the one essential to the apprehension of the
other. Revelation, you say, has given us the clew by which
to thread the labyrinth of creation, and extricate ourselves
from its passages of mystery and gloom. Be it so; still,
<i>there</i>, in the scene thus cleared of its perplexity, must our
worship be paid, and the manifestations of Deity be sought.
If the use of revelation be to explain the perplexities of Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
and life, it would be a strange use to make of the explanation
were we to turn away from the thing explained.
We hold the key of heaven in our hands. What folly to be
for ever extolling and venerating it, whilst we prohibit all approach
to the temple whose gates it is destined to unlock.</p>

<p>One would search long to find a finer illustration
than is here given of the real</p>


<h4>NATURE OF DEVOTION.</h4>

<p>In Devotion there is this great peculiarity,&mdash;that it is neither
the <i>work</i> nor the <i>play</i> of our nature, but is something
higher than either,&mdash;more ideal than the one, more real than
the other. All human activities besides are one of these two
things,&mdash;either the mere aim at an external end, or the mere
outcome of an inner feeling. On the one hand, we plough
and sow, we build and navigate, that we may win the adornments
and securities of life; on the other hand, we sing and
dance, we carve and paint, that we may put forth the pressure
of harmony and joy and beauty breaking from within. Mechanical
Toil terminates in a solid product; graceful Art is
content with simple expression; but Religion is degraded
when it is reduced to either character. It is not a labor of
utility; and he who looks to it as a means of safety, to ingratiate
himself with an awful God, and bespeak an interest in a
hidden Future, is an utter stranger to its essence; his habits
and words may be cast in its mould, but the spark of its life
is not kindled in his heart. When fed by the fuel of prudence,
the fire is all spent in fusing it into form; and the
finished product is a cold and metal mimicry, that neither
moves nor glows. Nor is Religion a simple gesture of passion;
and to class it with mere natural language, to treat it
as the rhythmical delirium of the soul working off an irrepressible
enthusiasm, is to empty it of its real meaning and
contents, and sink it from a divine attraction to a human
excitement. The postures and movements and tones which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
simply manifest the impassioned mind are content to go off
into space, and pass away; they direct themselves nowhither;
they have no more <i>object</i> than a convulsion; they ask only
leave to be the last shape of a feeling that must have way;
and be the inspiration what it may, they close and consummate
its history. But he who <i>prays</i> is at the beginning of
aspiration, not at the evaporating end of impulse; he is
drawn, not driven; he is not painting <i>himself</i> upon vacancy,
but is surrendering himself to a Presence real and everlasting.
If he flings out his arms, it is not in blind paroxysm,
but that he may embrace and be embraced; if he cries aloud,
it is that he may be heard; if he makes melody of the silent
heart, it is no soliloquy flung into emptiness, but the low-breathing
love of spirit to Spirit. Devotion is not the play
even of the highest faculties, but their deep earnest. It is no
doubt the culminating point of reverence; but reverence is
impossible without an object, and could never culminate at
all, or pass into the Infinite, unless its object did so too. In
every case we find that the faculties and susceptibilities of a
being tell true, and are the exact measure of the outer life it
has to live; and just as many and as large proportions as it
has, to just so many and so great objects does it stand related;
so that from the axis of its nature you may always draw
the curve of its existence. Human worship, therefore, turning
to the living God as the infant's eye to light, is itself a
witness to Him whom it feels after and adores; it is "the
image and shadow of heavenly things," the parallel chamber
in our nature with that Holy of Holies whither its incense
ever ascends.</p>

<p>In a similar strain is this argument to show that</p>


<h4>DEVOTION IS NOT A MISTAKE.</h4>

<p>Be assured, all visible greatness of mind grows in looking
at an invisible that is greater. And since it is inconceivable
that what is most sublime in humanity should spring from vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of a thing that is not, that what is most real and commanding
with us should come of stretching the soul into the
unreal and empty, that historic durability should be the gift
of spectral fancies, we must hold these devout natures to be
at one with everlasting Fact,&mdash;to feel truly that the august
forms of Justice and Holiness are at home in heaven, the object
there of clearer insight and more perfect veneration.
There are those who please themselves with the idea that the
world will outgrow its habits of worship; that the newspaper
will supersede the preacher and prophet; that the apprehension
of scientific laws will replace the fervor of moral inspirations;
that this sphere of being will then be perfectly
administered when no reference to another distracts attention.
But, for my own part, I am persuaded, that life would soon
become intolerable on earth, were it copied from nothing in
the heavens; that its deeper affections would pine away and
its lights of purest thought grow pale, if it lay shrouded in no
Holy Spirit, but only in the wilderness of space. The most
sagacious secular voice leaves, after all, a chord untouched in
the human heart: listening too long to its didactic monotone,
we begin to sigh for the rich music of hope and faith. The
dry glare of noonday knowledge hurts the eye by plying it
for use and denying it beauty; and we long to be screened
behind a cloud or two of moisture and of mystery, that shall
mellow the glory and cool the air. Never can the world be
less to us, than when we make it all in all.</p>

<p>Our author makes a striking reply to the common
assertion that</p>


<h4>"THEOLOGY IS NOT A PROGRESSIVE SCIENCE."</h4>

<p>It may, however, be retrogressive; and it is sure to repay
flippant neglect by lending its empty space to mean delusions.
To its great problems <i>some</i> answer will always be attempted;
and there is much to choose between the solutions, however
imperfect, found by reverential wisdom, and the degrading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
falsehoods tendered in reply by the indifferent and superficial.
Even in their failures, there is a vast difference between the
explorings of the seeing and the blind. We deny, however,
that Christian theology can assume any aspect of failure,
except to those who use a false measure of success. It is
not in the nature of religion, of poetry, of art, to exhibit the
kind of progress that belongs to physical science. They differ
from it in seeking, not the <i>phenomena</i> of the universe, but
its <i>essence</i>,&mdash;not its laws of change, but its eternal meanings,&mdash;not
outward nature, in short, except as expressive of the inner
thought of God; and being thus intent upon the enduring
spirit and very ground of things, they cannot grow by numerical
accretion of facts and exacter registration of successions.
They are the product, not of the patient sense and
comparing intelligence which are always at hand, but of a
deeper and finer insight, changing with the atmosphere of the
affections and will. Instead of looking, therefore, for perpetual
advance of discovery in theology, we should naturally
expect an ebb and flow of light, answering to the moral condition
of men's minds; and may be content if the divine
truth, lost in the dulness of a material age, clears itself into
fresh forms with the returning breath of a better time.</p>

<p>Most readers will find suggestions of great freshness
in the passage next cited:&mdash;</p>


<h4>THE HEART OF CHRISTIANITY.</h4>

<p>To lose sight of this principle in estimating Christianity,
and to insist on judging it, not by its matured character in
Christendom, not by the <i>unconscious spirit</i> of its founders,
but by their personal views and purposes, is to overlook the
divine in it in order to fasten on the human; to seek the
winged creature of the air in the throbbing chrysalis; and
is like judging the place of the Hebrews in history by the
court and the proverbs of Solomon, or the value of Puritanism
by the sermon of a hill-preacher before the civil war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
The primitive Christianity was certainly <i>different</i> from that
of other ages; but there is no reason for believing that it
was <i>better</i>. The representation often made of the early
Church, as having only truth, and feeling only love, and living
in simple sanctity, is contradicted by every page of the
Christian records. The Epistles are entirely occupied in
driving back guilt and passion, or in correcting errors of belief;
nor is it <i>always</i> possible to approve of the temper in
which they perform the one task, or to assent to the methods
by which they attempt the other. Principles and affections
were indeed secreted in the heart of the first disciples, which
were to have a great future, and to become the highest truth
of the world. But it was precisely of these that they rarely
thought at all. The Apostles themselves speak slightingly of
them, as baby's food; and the great faith in God, the need of
repentant purity of heart, with the trust in immortality,&mdash;the
very doctrines which we should name as the permanent
essence of Christian faith,&mdash;are expressly declared by them
to be the childish rudiments of belief, on which the attention
of the grown Christian will disdain to dwell. And what did
they prefer to these sublime truths, as the nutriment of their
life and the pride of their wisdom? Allegories about Isaac
and Ishmael, parallels between Christ and Melchisedec, new
readings of history and prophecy to suit the events in Palestine,
and a constant outlook for the end of all things. These
were the grand topics on which their minds eagerly worked,
and on which they labored to construct a consistent theory.
These give the form to their doctrine, the matter to their
spirit. These are what you will get, if you go indiscriminately
to their writings for a creed: and these are no more
Christianity than the pretensions of Hildebrand or the visions
of Swedenborg. The true religion lies elsewhere, just in the
things that were <i>ever present with them, but never esteemed</i>.
Just as your friend may spend his anxiety on his station, his
usefulness, his appearance and repute, and fear lest he should
show nothing deserving your regard, while all the time you
love him for the pure graces, the native wild-flowers, of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
heart; so do the choicest servants of God ever think one
thing of themselves, while they are dear to him and revered
by us for quite another. "The weak things" in the Church
not less than in "the world hath he chosen to confound the
mighty; the simple, to strike dumb the wise; and things that
are not, to supersede the things that are."</p>

<p>In rude ages, and amid feudal customs, it has perhaps been
no unhappy thing that this image of servitude has been transmitted
into the conceptions of faith: it may have touched
with some sanctity an inevitable submission, and mingled a
sentiment of loyalty with religion. But the <i>external relation</i>
of serf and lord is no type of the <i>internal relation</i> of spirit
to spirit, which alone constitutes religion to us. To God
himself, with all his infinitude, we are not <i>slaves</i>; we are not
his <i>property</i>, but his children; he regards us, not as <i>things</i>,
but as <i>persons</i>; he does not so much command us, as appeal
to us; and in our obedience, it is not his <i>bidding</i> that we
serve, but that divine Law of Right of which he makes us
conscious as the rule of His nature only more perfectly than
of ours. To obey him as <i>slaves</i>, in fear, and with an eye
upon his power, is, with all our punctuality and anxiety, simply
and entirely to <i>disobey</i> him; nor is anything precious in
his sight, except the free consent of heart with which we
apprehend what is holy to his thought and embrace what is
in harmony with his perfection. Still less can we be <i>slaves</i>
to Christ, who is no autocrat to us, but our freely followed
leader towards God; the guide of our pilgrim troop in quest
of a holy land; who gives us no law from the mandates of
his will, but only interprets for us, and makes burn within
us, in characters of fire, the law of our own hearts; who has
no power over us, except through the affections he awakens
and the aspirations he sets upon the watch. We have emerged
from the Religion of <i>Law</i>, whose only sentiment is that of
<i>obedience to sovereignty</i>; we have passed from the religion of
<i>Salvation</i>, whose life consists in <i>gratitude to a Deliverer</i>; and
we are capable only of a religion of <i>reverence</i>, which bows
before the <i>authority of Goodness</i>. And in the infinite ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
of excellence, from the highest to the lowest, there are no
lords and slaves; the dependence is ever that of internal
charm, not of external bond; the <i>authority</i> is but represented
and impersonated in another and a better soul, but has its
living seat within our own; and in this true and elevating
worship, the more we are disposed of by another, the more
do we feel that we are our own. This is a relation which
the political terms of the expected theocracy are ill adapted
to express; and if we have required many centuries to grope
our way to this clearest glory of religion, to disengage it
from the impure admixture of servile fear and revolting presumption;
if it has taken long for us to melt away in our
imagination the images of thrones and tribunals, of prize-givings
and prisons, of a police and assizes of the universe;
if only at the eleventh hour of our faith, the cloud has passed
away, and shown us the true angel-ladder that springs from
earth to heaven, the pure climax of souls whereon each below
looks up and rises, yet each above bends down and helps;&mdash;the
discovery which brings such peace and freedom to the
heart, has been delayed by the mistaken identification of the
entire creed of the first age with the essence of Christianity.
Now that God has shown us so much more, has tried the
divine seed of the Gospel on so various a soil of history, and
enabled us to distinguish its fairest blossoms and its choicest
fruits, a much larger meaning than was possible at first must
be given to the purpose of his revelation. Even to Paul,
Christ was mainly the great representative of a theocratic
idea; and was in no other sense an object of <i>spiritual</i> belief,
than that he was not on earth and mortal, but in heaven and
immortal. That <i>faith</i> in Christ, which then prominently
denoted belief in his appointed return, and <i>allegiance</i> to him
as God's viceroy in this world, is now transferred into quite
a different thing. It is altogether a moral and affectionate
sentiment: an acknowledgment of him as the highest impersonation
of divine excellence and inspired insight yet given
to the world; a trust in him as the only realized type of perfection
that can mediate for us between ourselves and God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
a faithfulness to him, as making us conscious of what we are
and what God and our conscience would have us to be. It is
vain to pretend that revelation is a fixed and stereotyped
thing. It was born, as the divinest things must be, among
human conditions; and into it ever since human conditions
have perpetually flowed. The elements of Hebrew thought
surrounded the sacred centre at first, and have been erroneously
identified with it by all Unitarian churches in every
age. The Hellenic intellect afterwards streamed towards the
fresh point of life and faith, and gathered around it the metaphysical
system of Trinitarian dogma in which orthodox
communions of all times have, with parallel error, sought the
essence of the Gospel. The true principle of the religion has
been <i>secreted in both, and consisted in neither</i>: it has lain
unnoticed in the midst, in the silent chamber of the heart,
around which the clamor of the disputatious intellect whirls
without entrance. The agency of Christ's mind as the expression
of God's moral nature and providence, and as the
realized ideal of beauty and excellence,&mdash;this is the power
of God and the wisdom of God, which has made vain the
counsels of the world, and baffled the foolishness of the
Church. This is the Gospel's centre of stability,&mdash;"Jesus
Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever."</p>

<p>Few persons can be insensible to the sublimity of
this expression upon the relation between</p>


<h4>CHRIST, NATURE, PROVIDENCE, AND GOD.</h4>

<p>In conclusion, then, I revert, with freshened persuasion, to
the statement with which I commenced. Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, God hath presented to us simply in his inspired
humanity. Him we accept, not indeed as very God, but as
the true image of God, commissioned to show what no written
doctrinal record could declare, the entire moral perfections
of Deity. We accept, not indeed his body, not the struggles
of his sensitive nature, not the travail of his soul, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
his purity, his tenderness, his absolute devotion to the great
idea of right, his patient and compassionate warfare against
misery and guilt, as the most distinct and beautiful expression
of the Divine mind. The peculiar office of Christ is to
supply a new <i>moral</i> image of Providence; and everything,
therefore, except the <i>moral</i> complexion of his mind, we leave
behind as human and historical merely, and apply to no religious
use. I have already stated in what way nature and
the Gospel combine to bring before us the great object of our
trust and worship. The universe gives us the scale of God,
and Christ, his Spirit. We climb to the infinitude of his
nature by the awful pathway of the stars, where whole forests
of worlds silently quiver here and there, like a small leaf of
light. We dive into his eternity, through the ocean waves
of time, that roll and solemnly break on the imagination, as
we trace the wrecks of departed things upon our present
globe. The scope of his intellect, and the majesty of his
rule, are seen in the tranquil order and everlasting silence
that reign through the fields of his volition. And the spirit
that animates the whole is like that of the Prophet of Nazareth;
the thoughts that fly upon the swift light throughout
creation, charged with fates unnumbered, are like the healing
mercies of One that passed no sorrow by. The government
of this world, its mysterious allotments of good and ill, its
successions of birth and death, its hopes of progress and of
peace, each life of individual or nation, is under the administration
of One, of whose rectitude and benevolence, whose
sympathy with all the holiest aspirations of our virtue and
our love, Christ is the appointed emblem. A faith that
spreads around and within the mind a Deity thus sublime
and holy, feeds the light of every pure affection, and presses
with omnipotent power on the conscience; and our only
prayer is, that we may walk as children of such light.</p>

<p>It seems as if no one capable of understanding could
resist the convincing cogency of the following exhibition
of</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE IDEA OF VICARIOUS JUSTICE.</h4>

<p>It is only natural that the parable of the Prodigal Son
should be no favorite with those who deny the unconditional
mercy of God. The place which this divine tale occupies in
the Unitarian theology appears to be filled, in the orthodox
scheme, by the story of Zaleucus, king of the Locrians;
which has been appealed to in the present controversy by
both the lecturers on the Atonement, and seems to be the
only endurable illustration presented, even by Pagan history,
of the execution of vicarious punishment. This monarch
had passed a law condemning adulterers to the loss of both
eyes. His own son was convicted of the crime; and, to satisfy
at once the claims of law and of clemency, the royal
parent "commanded one of his own eyes to be pulled out, and
one of his son's." Is it too bold a heresy to confess that
there seems to me something heathenish in this example, and
that, as an exponent of the Divine character, I more willingly
revere the Father of the prodigal than the father of the adulterer?</p>

<p>Without entering, however, into any comparison between
the Locrian and the Galilean parable, I would observe, that
the vicarious theory receives no illustration from this fragment
of ancient history. There is no analogy between the
cases, except in the violation of truth and wisdom which both
exhibit; and whatever we are instructed to admire in Zaleucus,
will be found on close inspection to be absent from the
orthodox representation of God. We pity the Grecian king,
who had made a law without foresight of its application, and
so sympathize with his desire to evade it, that any quibble
which legal ingenuity can devise for this purpose passes with
slight condemnation; casuistry refuses to be severe with a
man implicated in such a difficulty. But the Creator and
Legislator of the human race, having perfect knowledge of
the future, can never be surprised into a similar perplexity;
or ever pass a law at one time which at another he desires to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
evade. Even were it so, there would seem to be less that is
unworthy of his moral perfection in saying plainly, with the
ancient Hebrews, that he "repented of the evil he thought
to do," and said, "It shall not be," than in ascribing to him a
device for preserving consistency, in which no one capable of
appreciating veracity can pretend to discern any sincere fulfilment
of the law. However barbarous the idea of Divine
"repentance," it is at least ingenuous. Nor does this incident
of Zaleucus and his son present any parallel to the alleged
relation between the Divine Father who receives, and the
Divine Son who gives, the satisfaction for human guilt. The
Locrian king took a part of the penalty himself, and left the
remainder where it was due; but the Sovereign Lawgiver
of Calvinism puts the whole upon another. To sustain the
analogy, Zaleucus should have permitted an innocent son to
have both his eyes put out, and the convicted adulterer to
escape.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Atonement has introduced among Trinitarians
a mode of speaking respecting God, which grates most
painfully against the reverential affections due to him. His
nature is dismembered into a number of attributes, foreign to
each other, and preferring rival claims; the Divine tranquillity
appears as the equilibrium of opposing pressures,&mdash;the
Divine administration as a resultant from the collision of hostile
forces. Goodness pleads for that which holiness forbids;
and the Paternal God would do many a mercy, did the Sovereign
God allow. The idea of a conflict or embarrassment
in the Supreme Mind being thus introduced, and the believer
being haunted by the feeling of some tremendous difficulty
affecting the Infinite government, the vicarious economy is
brought forward as the relief, the solution of the whole perplexity;
the union, by a blessed compromise, of attributes
that could never combine in any scheme before. The main
business of theology is made to consist in stating the conditions
and expounding the solution of this imaginary problem.
The cardinal difficulty is thought to be the reconciliation of
justice and mercy; and, as the one is represented under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
image of a Sovereign, the other under that of a Father, the
question assumes this form: How can the same being at every
moment possess both these characters, without abandoning
any function or feeling appropriate to either? how, especially,
can the Judge remit?&mdash;it is beyond his power; yet how can
the Parent punish to the uttermost?&mdash;it is contrary to his
nature.</p>

<p>All this difficulty is merely fictitious, arising out of the
determination to make out that God is both wholly Judge and
wholly Father; from an anxiety, that is, to adhere to two
metaphors, as applicable, in every particular, to the Divine
Being. It is evident that both must be, to a great extent, inappropriate;
and in nothing, surely, is the impropriety more
manifest, than in the assertion that, as sovereign, God is naturally
bound to execute laws which, nevertheless, it would
be desirable to remit, or change in their operation. Whatever
painful necessities the imperfection of human legislation
and judicial procedure may impose, the Omniscient Ruler
can make no law which he will not to all eternity, and with
entire consent of his whole nature, deem it well to execute.
This is the Unitarian answer to the constant question, "How
can God forgive in defiance of his own law?" It is not in
defiance of his laws: every one of which will be fulfilled to
the uttermost, in conformity with his first intent; but nowhere
has he declared that he would not forgive. All justice consists
in treating moral agents according to their character;
the inexorability of human law arises solely from the imperfection
with which it can attain this end, and is not the essence,
but the alloy, of equity; but God, who searches and
controls the heart, exercises that perfect justice, which permits
the penal suffering to depart only with the moral guilt;
and pardons, not by cancelling any sentence, but by obeying
his eternal purpose to meet the wanderer returning homeward,
and give his blessing to the restored. Only by such
restoration can any past guilt be effaced. The thoughts, emotions,
and sufferings of sin, once committed, are woven into
the fabric of the soul; and are as incapable of being absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
obliterated thence and put back into non-existence, as
moments of being struck from the past, or the parts of space
from infinitude. Herein we behold alike "the goodness and
the severity of God"; and adore in him, not the balance of
contrary tendencies, but the harmony of consentaneous perfections.
How plainly does experience show that, if his personal
unity be given up, his moral unity cannot be preserved!</p>

<p>The author himself is the best exemplification of the
man described in this account of the</p>


<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPREHENSION AND INTERPRETATION.</h4>

<p>The difference between the ordinary visual gaze upon the
external universe, and the interpreting glance of science, is
felt by every cultivated understanding to be immeasurable;&mdash;and
the contrast is not less between that dull sense of what
passes within him, which is forced upon a man by mere
practical experience, and the exact consciousness, the discriminative
perception, the easy comprehension of his own (and,
so far as they are expressed by faithful symbols, of others')
states and affections, possessed by the patient analyst of
thought and emotion, and careful collector of their laws. The
mighty mass of human achievement and human failure, in
intellectual research, in moral endeavor, in social economy
and government, lapses into order before him, and distributes
itself among the provinces of determinate laws. The structure
of a child's perplexity, and the fallacies of the most ambitious
hypothesis, lie open to him as readily, as to the artisan
a flaw in the fabric of his own craft. The creations of art
fall before him into their elements; and, dissolving away
their constituent <i>matter</i>, which is an accident of their age,
leave upon his mind their permanent <i>form</i> of beauty, as his
guide to a true and noble criticism. The progress and the
aberrations of human reason, in its quest of truth, are as
clearly appreciated by him, as the passages of happy skill or
ignorant roving in some voyage of discovery, when the outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
and relations of the sphere on which it is made become
fully known. Discerning distinctly the different kinds of
evidence appropriate to different departments of truth, and
weighing the scientific value of every idea and method of
thought, he is not at the mercy of each superficial impression
and obtrusive phase presented to him by the subjects of his
contemplation; but he attains a certain rational tact and
graduated feeling of certainty in abstract matters of opinion,
by which he escapes alike the miseries of undefined doubt,
and the passions of unqualified dogmatism. In short, the
great idea of Science is applied by him to the complicated
workings of the mind of man; interprets the activities of his
nature, and gives laws to the administration of his life; and,
with wonderful analysis, investigates the properties, and establishes
the equation, of their most labyrinthine curves.</p>

<p>What a rebuke upon dogmatic sciolists, what a
glorious invitation to study, are conveyed in the
genial, broad, mental hospitality of the succeeding paragraph!</p>


<h4>NECESSITY OF LEARNING IN PHILOSOPHY.</h4>

<p>If there is one department of knowledge more than another
in which a contemptuous disregard of the meditations and
theories of distant periods and nations is misplaced, it is in
the philosophy of man,&mdash;which can have no adequate
breadth of basis till it reposes on the consciousness and covers
the mental experience of the universal race; and to construct
which out of purely personal materials, is like attempting to
lay down the curves and finish the theory of terrestrial magnetism
on the strength of a few closet experiments. No man,
however large-thoughted and composite his mind, can accept
of <i>himself</i> as the type of universal human nature. It will
even be a great and rare endowment, if, with every aid of
exact learning and unwearying patience, he is able to penetrate
the atmosphere of others' understanding, and to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
the forms and colors which the objects of contemplation assume,
when beheld through this peculiar medium. Simply to
avail one's self of the experience of mankind, and know what
it has really been, demands no little scope of imagination
and versatility of intellectual sympathy. When these qualities
are so deficient in a thinker that he cannot well achieve
this knowledge, it is a great misfortune to his philosophy;
when the want is such that he does not even desire it, it
amounts to an absolute disqualification. Without, therefore,
pledging ourselves to the eclectic principles which prevail in
the present school of philosophy in France, we must beware
of the intolerant dogmatism of Bentham in England, sanctioned,
as we have seen, by one of the masters of the antagonist
metaphysics in Germany. Indeed, it will be a chief
purpose of all my lectures to enable you to profit by the light
of other minds; in every province of the vast region which
we shall explore together, to indicate the paths which they
have traversed before, nor ever to turn away from their
points of discovery, without raising some rude monument at
least of honest and commemorative praise. To introduce you
to the works, to interpret the difficulties, to do honor to the
labors, to review the opinions, of the great masters of speculative
thought in every age and in many lands, will be an
indispensable portion of my duty;&mdash;a task most arduous
indeed, but than which none can be more grateful to one who
loves to trace, through all their affinities, the indestructible
types of truth and beauty in the human mind; and to mark
the natural laws, connecting together the most opposite continents
and climes of thought, as parts, successively colonized
and cultivated, of one great intellectual world. But in addition
to the study of the several classes of psychological and
moral doctrine as they present themselves in the <i>order of
science</i>, it will be important to spread out the literature of
philosophy before us in the <i>order of time</i>; to gain an insight
into the natural development of successive modes of thought
on speculative subjects; to notice the action and reaction of
philosophy and practical life; to ascertain whether opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
on these abstract matters really advances into knowledge and
has any determinate progression, or whether it oscillates for
ever on either side of some fixed idea, or line of mental gravitation.
In short, having surveyed our subject systematically,
we shall go over it again chronologically; and call upon philosophy,
when it has recited its creed, and revealed its wisdom,
to finish all by writing its history.</p>

<p>The hints given in Mr. Martineau's frequent references
to the bearing of scientific knowledge and laws
upon theological speculations are very important. We
adduce a single example.</p>


<h4>PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND RELIGION.</h4>

<p>An accomplished and thoughtful observer of nature&mdash;Hugh
Miller, the geologist&mdash;has somewhere remarked, that
religion has lost its dependence on metaphysical theories, and
must henceforth maintain itself upon the domain of physical
science. He accordingly exhorts the guardians of sacred
truth to prepare themselves for the approaching crisis in its
history, by exchanging the study of thoughts for the apprehension
of things, and carefully cultivating the habit of inductive
research. The advice is excellent, and proceeds from
one whose own example has amply proved its worth; and
unless the clergy qualify themselves to take part in the discussions
which open themselves with the advance of natural
knowledge, they will assuredly be neither secure in their personal
convictions nor faithful to their public trust. The only
fault to be found with this counsel is, that in recommending
one kind of knowledge it disparages another, and betrays that
limited intellectual sympathy which is the bane of all noble
culture. Geology, astronomy, chemistry, so far from succeeding
to the inheritance of metaphysics, do but enrich its problems
with new conceptions and give a larger outline to its
range; and should they, in the wantonness of their young
ascendency, persuade men to its neglect, they will pay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
penalties of their contempt by the appearance of confusion in
their own doctrine. The advance of any one line of human
thought demands&mdash;especially for the security of faith&mdash;the
parallel movement of all the rest; and the attempt to substitute
one intellectual reliance for another, mistakes for progress
of knowledge what may be only an exchange of ignorance.
In particular, the study of external nature must proceed <i>pari
passu</i> with the study of the human mind; and the errors of
an age too exclusively reflective will not be remedied, but
only reversed, by mere reaction into sciences of outward fact
and observation. These physical pursuits, followed into their
further haunts, rapidly run up into a series of notions common
to them all,&mdash;expressed by such words as <i>Law</i>, <i>Cause</i>,
<i>Force</i>,&mdash;which at once transfer the jurisdiction from the
provincial courts of the special sciences to the high chancery
of universal philosophy. To conduct the pleadings&mdash;still
more to pronounce the judgment&mdash;there, other habits of
mind are needed than are required in the museum and the
observatory; and the history of knowledge, past and present,
abounds with instances of men who, with the highest merit in
particular walks of science, have combined a curious incompetency
of survey over the whole. Hence, very few natural
philosophers, however eminent for great discoveries and
dreaded by the priesthood of their day, have made any deep
and durable impression on the religious conception of the
universe, as the product and expression of an Infinite Mind;
and in tracing the eras of human faith, the deep thinker
comes more prominently into view than the skilful interrogator
of nature. In the history of religion, Plato is a greater figure
than Archimedes; Spinoza than Newton; Hume and
Kant than Volta and La Place; even Thomas Carlyle than
Justus Liebig. Our picture indeed of the system of things is
immensely enlarged, both in space and duration, by the progress
of descriptive science; and the grouping of its objects
and events is materially changed. But the altered scene
carries with it the same expression to the soul; speaks the
same language as to its origin; renews its ancient glance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
an auguster beauty; and, in spite of all dynamic theories,
reproduces the very modes of faith and doubt which belonged
to the age both of the old Organon and of the new.</p>

<p>The ultimate problem of all philosophy and all religion is
this: "How are we to conceive aright the origin and first
principle of things?" The answers, it has been contended
by a living author of distinguished merit, are necessarily reducible
to two, between which all systems are divided, and on
the decision of whose controversy, all antagonist speculations
would lay down their arms. "In the beginning was <span class="smcap">Force</span>,"
says one class of thinkers; "force, singular or plural, splitting
into opposites, standing off into polarities, ramifying into
attractions and repulsions, heat and magnetism, and climbing
through the stages of physical, vital, animal, to the mental
life itself." "On the contrary," says the other class, "in the
beginning was <span class="smcap">Thought</span>; and only in the necessary evolution
of its eternal ideas into expression does force arise,&mdash;self-realizing
thought declaring itself in the types of being and
the laws of phenomena." We need hardly say, that the
former of these two notions coalesces with the creed of Atheism,
and is most frequently met with upon the path of the
physical sciences, while the latter is favored by the mathematical
and metaphysical, and gives the essence of Pantheism.
Each of them has insurmountable difficulties, with which it is
successfully taunted by the other. Start from blind force;
and how, by any spinning from that solitary centre, are we
ever to arrive at the seeing intellect? Can the lower create
the higher, and the unconscious enable us to think? Start
from pure thinking, and how then can you get any force for
the production of objective effects? How metamorphose a
passage of dialect into the power of gravitation, and a silent
corollary into a flash of lightning? In taking the intellect as
the type of God, this difficulty must always be felt. We are
well aware that it is not in <i>this</i> endowment that our dynamic
energy resides. The <i>activity</i> which we ascribe to our intellect
is not a power going out into external efficiency, but a
mere passage across the internal field of successive thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
as spontaneous phenomena. Nor have we, as thinking beings
only, any <i>option</i> with respect to the thoughts thus streaming
over the theatre of rational consciousness; our constitution
legislates for us in this particular, and the order of suggestion
is determined by laws having their seat in us. Finally,
we are not, by mere thinking capacity, constituted <i>persons</i>,
any more than a sleeper who should never wake, yet always
be engaged with rational and scientific dreams, would be a
person. Without some further endowment, we should only
be a <i>logical life</i> and development. All these characters are
imported into the conception of God, when he is represented
as conforming to the type of reason. The activity of intellect
being wholly internal, the phenomena of the Universe
could not be referred to Him as a thinking being, were they
not gathered up into the interior of his nature, and conceived,
not as objective effects of his power, but as purely
subjective successions within the theatre of his infinitude.
Intellect again having no option, the God of this theory is
without freedom, and is represented as the eternal necessity
of reason. And lastly, in fidelity to the same analogy, He
is not a divine <i>Person</i>, but rather a <i>Thinking Thing</i>, or the
thinking function of the universe; we may say, <i>universal
science in a state of self-consciousness</i>. The necessity under
which Pantheism lies, of fetching all that is to be referred to
God into the <i>interior</i> of his being, and dealing with it as not
less a necessary manifestation of his mental essence than are
our ideas of the mind that has them, explains the unwillingness
of this system to allow any motives to God, any field of
objective operation, any special relation to individuals, any
revealing interposition, any <i>supernatural</i> agency.</p>

<p>Is it however true, that human belief can only choose
between these two extremes, and must oscillate eternally between
the Atheistic homage to Force, and the Pantheistic to
Thought? Far from it; and it is curiously indicative of the
state of the philosophic atmosphere in Germany, that one of
her most discerning and wide-seeing authors should find no
third possibility within the sphere of vision. In any latitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
except one in which moral science has altogether melted
away in the universal solvent of metaphysics, it would occur
as one of the most obvious suggestions, that the intellect is
not the only element of human nature which may be taken
as type of the Divine, and as furnishing a possible solution to
the problem of origination. Quitting the two poles of extreme
philosophy, confessedly incompetent in their separation,
we submit that <span class="smcap">Will</span> presents the middle point which takes
up into itself Thought on the one hand and Force on the
other; and which yet, so far from appearing to us as a <i>compound</i>
arising out of them as an effect, is more easily conceived
than either as the originating prefix of all phenomena.
It has none of the disqualifications which we have remarked
as flowing from the others into their respective systems of
doctrine. It carries with it, in its very idea, the co-presence
of Thought, as the necessary element within whose sphere it
has to manifest itself. Its phenomena cannot exist <i>alone</i>; it
acts on preconceptions, which stand related to it, however, not
as its source, but as its conditions, and are its co-ordinates in
the effect rather than its generating antecedents. If therefore
all things are issued by Will, there is Mind at the fountain-head,
and the absurdity is avoided of deriving intelligence
from unintelligence. While it thus escapes the difficulty
of passing from mere Force to Thought, it is equally
clear of the opposite difficulty of making mere Thought supply
any Force. The activity of Will is not, like that of Intellect,
a subjective transit of regimented ideas, but an <i>objective</i>
power <i>going out</i> for the production of effects; nay, it is
a <i>free</i> power, exercising <i>preference</i> among data furnished by
internal or external conditions present in its field; and it thus
constitutes proper <i>Causality</i>, which always implies control
over an alternative. We need hardly add, that all the requisites
are thus complete for the true idea of a <i>Person</i>; and
an Infinite Being contemplated under this type is neither a
fateful nor a logical principle of necessity, but a living God,
out of whose purposed legislation has sprung whatever necessity
there is, except the self-existent beauty of his holiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
Thus, between the Force of the physical Atheist, and the
Thought of the metaphysical Pantheist, we fix upon the fulcrum
of Will as the true balance-point of a moral Theism.</p>

<h4>LESSING'S THEOLOGICAL CONCLUSIONS.</h4>

<p>Lessing refused to surrender Christianity, on proof of error
in its first teachers, uncertainty in its reported miracles, contradictions
in its early literature, misapplication of Messianic
prophecies. All these he regards as but the external accidents,
the transitory media, of the religion, constituting, it may
be, its support in one age and its weakness in another. They
do not belong to its inner essence, in which alone the real
evidence of spiritual truth is found; and he who detects anything
amiss with them may even render a service by driving
men from sham-proofs, that really persuade no one, to true
ones that lie at the heart of things. Religious doctrine cannot
be deduced from mere historical facts without a μεταβασις εις αλλο γενος vitiating the whole process. <i>Facts</i> indeed <i>may</i>
become the proper ground of moral and spiritual faith; but
then they must be facts which come over again and again,
and betray an element that is permanent and eternal; which
form part of the experience and consciousness of humanity;
and ally themselves with the Divine by not losing their <i>presence</i>
in the world. But <i>unrepeated facts</i>, which limit themselves
to a moment, which are the incidents of a single
personality, and are left behind quite insulated in the past,
show&mdash;were it only by your not expecting them again&mdash;that
they are detached from the persistent and essential life
of the universe and humanity. They are but once and
away; and least of all, therefore, can testify of the untransitory
and ever-living. The real can teach us only so far as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
has an ideal kernel, redeeming it from the character of a
solitary phenomenon. Among the various expositions and
applications of this favorite theme of Lessing's, we select the
following sentences from his Axiomata.</p>

<p>1. "The Bible evidently contains more than belongs to
Religion."</p>

<p>2. "That in this '<i>more</i>' the Bible is still infallible, is mere
hypothesis."</p>

<p>3. "The letter is not the spirit, and the Bible is not the
Religion."</p>

<p>4. "The objections therefore against the letter and against
the Bible, are not on that account objections against the spirit
and against the Religion."</p>

<p>5. "Moreover there was a religion ere there was a Bible."</p>

<p>6. "Christianity was in being before Evangelists and Apostles
had written. Some time elapsed before the first of them
wrote, and a very considerable time before the whole canon
was constituted."</p>

<p>7. "However much, therefore, may depend on these writings,
it is impossible that the whole truth of the Christian religion
can rest upon them."</p>

<p>8. "If there was a period during which, diffused as the
Christian religion already was, and many as were the souls
filled already with its power, still not a letter had yet been
written of the records which have come down to us; then it
must be also possible for all the writings of Evangelists and
Apostles to perish, yet the religion taught by them still to
subsist."</p>

<p>9. "The religion is not true because Evangelists and Apostles
taught it; but they taught it because it is true."</p>

<p>10. "Its interior truth must furnish the interpretation of the
writings it has handed down; and no writings handed down
can give it interior truth, if it has none."</p>

<p>In his controversy with Göze, he illustrates this distinction
between the essence and the historical form of Christianity,
by a parable to the following effect. A wise king of a great
realm built a palace of immense size and very peculiar architecture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
About this structure, there came from the very first
a foolish strife to be carried on, especially among reputed
connoisseurs, people, that is, who had least looked into the interior.
This strife was not about the palace itself, but about
various old ground-plans of it, and drawings of the same,
very difficult to make out. Once, when the watchmen cried
out "Fire," these connoisseurs, instead of running to help,
snatched up their plans, and, instead of putting out the fire on
the spot, kept standing with their plans in hand, making a
hubbub all the while, and squabbling about whether this was
the spot on fire, and that the place to put it out. Happily,
the safety of the palace did not depend on these busy wranglers,
for it was not on fire at all; the watchmen had been
frightened by the Northern lights, and mistaken them for
fire. It is impossible to convey by a clearer image Lessing's
feeling, that a Christianity once incorporated in the very substance
of history and civilization, seated deep in human sentiment
and thought, and developed into literature, law, and
life, subsists independently of critical questions, and is with
us, not as the contingent vapor that a wind may rise to blow
away, but as the cloud that has dropped its rain and mingled
with the roots of things.</p>

<p>In immediate contrast with the foregoing application
of a critical method to the historic documents of
Christianity, it is beautiful to see the same genius
turned with eager joy to a practical recommendation
of the experimental life of Christianity.</p>


<h4>THE REDEEMING LAW OF SYMPATHY.</h4>

<p>It is quite true, that self-cure is of all things the most arduous;
but that which is impossible <i>to the man within us</i>, may
be altogether possible <i>to the God</i>. In truth, the denial of
such changes, under the affectation of great knowledge of
man, shows an incredible ignorance of men. Why, the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
of every great religious revolution, such as the spread of
Methodism, is made up of nothing else; the instances occurring
in such number and variety, as to transform the character
of whole districts and vast populations, and to put all scepticism
at utter defiance. And if some more philosophic authority
is needed for the fact, we may be content with the
sanction of Lord Bacon, who observed that a man reforms
his habits either altogether or not at all. Deterioration of
mind is indeed always gradual; recovery usually sudden; for
God, by a mystery of mercy, has established this distinction
in our secret nature,&mdash;that, while we cannot, by one dark
plunge, sympathize with guilt far beneath us, but gaze at it
with recoil till intermediate shades have rendered the degradation
tolerable, we are yet capable of sympathizing with
moral excellence and beauty infinitely above us; so that,
while the debased may shudder and sicken at even the true
picture of themselves, they can feel the silent majesty of self-denying
and disinterested duty. With a demon can no man
feel complacency, though the demon be himself; but God can
all spirits reverence, though his holiness be an infinite deep.
And thus the soul, privately uneasy at its insincere state, is
prepared, when vividly presented with some sublime object
veiled before, to be pierced, as by a flash from heaven, with
an instant veneration, sometimes intense enough to fuse the
fetters of habit, and drop them to the earth whence they were
forged. The mind is ready, like a liquid on the eve of crystallization,
to yield up its state on the touch of the first sharp
point, and dart, over its surface and in its depths, into brilliant
and beautiful forms, and from being turbid and weak as
water, to become clear as crystal, and solid as the rock.</p>

<p>One of the most elaborate and valuable productions
from Mr. Martineau's pen, an article closely allied in
all respects to the ensuing Studies of Christianity, is
the one of some portions of which we herewith present
an epitome.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF MORAL EVIL.</h4>

<p>The Divine sentiments towards right and wrong every man
naturally believes to be a reflection of whatever is most pure
and solemn in his own. We cannot be sincerely persuaded,
that God looks with aversion on dispositions which we revere
as good and noble; or that he regards with lax indifference
the selfish and criminal passions which awaken our own disgust.
We may well suppose, indeed, his scrutiny more
searching, his estimate more severely true, his rebuking look
more awful, than our self-examination and remorse can fitly
represent; but we cannot doubt that our moral emotions, as
far as they go, are in sympathy with his; that we know, by
our own consciousness, the general direction of his approval
and displeasure; and that, in proportion as our perceptions
of duty are rendered clear, our judgment more nearly approaches
the precision of the Omniscient award. Our own
conscience is the window of heaven through which we gaze
on God; and, as its colors perpetually change, his aspect
changes too;&mdash;if they are bright and fair, he dwells as in the
warm light of a rejoicing love; if they are dark and turbid, he
hides himself in robes of cloud and storm. When you have
lost your self-respect, you have never thought yourself an
object of Divine complacency. In moments fresh from sin,
flushed with the shame of an insulted mind, when you have
broken another resolve, or turned your back upon a noble
toil, or succumbed to a mean passion, or lapsed into the sickness
of self-indulgence, could you ever turn a clear and open
face to God, nor think it terrible to meet his eye? Could
you imagine yourself in congeniality with him, when you
gave yourself up to the voluble sophistry of self-excuse, and
the loose hurry of forgetfulness? Or did you not discern him
rather in your own accusing heart, and meet him in the silent
anguish of full confession, and find in the recognition of your
alienation the first hope of return? To all unperverted
minds, the verdict of conscience sounds with a preternatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
voice; it is not the homely talk of their own poor judgment,
but an oracle of the sanctuary. There is something of anticipation
in our remorse, as well as of retrospect; and we feel
that it is not the mere survey of a gloomy past with the slow
lamp of our understanding, but a momentary piercing of the
future with the vivid lightning of the skies. Our moral nature,
left to itself, intuitively believes that guilt is an estrangement
from God,&mdash;an unqualified opposition to his will,&mdash;a literal
service of the enemy; that he abhors it, and will give it no
rest till it is driven from his presence, that is, into annihilation;
that no part of our mind belongs to him but the pure,
and just, and disinterested affections which he fosters, the
faithful will which he strengthens, the virtue, often damped,
whose smoking flax he will not quench, and the good resolves,
ever frail, whose bruised reed he will not break; and
that he has no relation but of displeasure, no contact but of
resistance, with our selfishness and sin. In the simple faith of
the conscience it is no figure of speech to say, that God "is
angry with the wicked every day," and is "of purer eyes
than to behold iniquity." So long as the natural religion
of the heart is undisturbed, to sin is, in the plainest and
most positive sense, to set up against Heaven, and frustrate
its will.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the understanding disturbs the tranquillity
of this belief, and constructs a rival creed. The primitive
conception of God is acquired, I believe, without reasoning,
and emerges from the affections; it is a transcript of our own
emotions,&mdash;an investiture of them with external personality
and infinite magnitude. But a secondary idea of Deity arises
in the intellect, from its reasonings about causation. Curiosity
is felt respecting the origin of things; and the order,
beauty, and mechanism of external nature are too conspicuous
not to force upon the observation the conviction of
a great Architect of the universe, from whose designing
reason its forces and its laws mysteriously sprung. Hence
the <i>intellectual</i> conception of <i>God the Creator</i>, which comes
into inevitable collision with the <i>moral</i> notion of <i>God the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
watch of virtue</i>. For if the system of creation is the production
of his Omniscience; if he has constituted human
nature as it is, and placed it in the scene whereon it acts; if
the arrangements by which happiness is allotted, and character
is formed, are the contrivance of his thought and the
work of his hand,&mdash;then the sufferings and the guilt of every
being were objects of his original contemplation, and the
productions of his own design. The deed of crime must, in
this case, be as much an integral part of his Providence, as
the efforts and sacrifices of virtue; and the monsters of licentiousness
and tyranny, whose images deform the scenery of
history, are no less truly his appointed instruments, than the
martyr and the sage. And though we remain convinced that
he does not make choice of evil in his government for its
own sake, but only for ultimate ends worthy of his perfections,
still we can no longer see how he can truly hate that
which he employs for the production of good. That which is
his chosen instrument cannot be sincerely regarded as his
everlasting enemy; and only figuratively can he be said to
repudiate a power which he continually wields. There must
be <i>some sense</i> in which it appears, in the eye of Omniscience,
to be eligible; some point of view at which its horrors
vanish; and where the moral distinctions, which we feel
ourselves impelled to venerate, disappear from the regards
of God.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a fearful contradiction between the religion
of conscience and the religion of the understanding; the one
pronouncing evil to be the antagonist, the other to be the
agent, of the Divine will. In every age has this difficulty
laid a heavy weight upon the human heart; in every age has
it pointed the sarcasm of the blasphemer, mingled an occasional
sadness with the hopes of benevolence, and tinged the
devotion of the thoughtful with a somewhat melancholy trust.
The whole history of speculative religion is one prolonged
effort of the human mind to destroy this contrariety; system
after system has been born in the struggle to cast the oppression
off,&mdash;with what result, it will be my object at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
to explain. The question which we have to consider is this,
"How should a Christian think of the origin and existence of
evil?" I propose to advert, first, to the speculative; secondly,
to the scriptural; thirdly, to the moral relations of the subject;
to inquire what relief we can obtain from philosophical
schemes, from biblical doctrine, and from practical Christianity.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us then, for final decision, consult the practical spirit
of Christianity, and ascertain to what view of the origin of
sin it awards the preference. Is it well for the consciences
and characters of men, to consider God&mdash;either directly or
through his dependant, Satan, either by his general laws
or by vitiating the constitution of our first parents&mdash;as the
primary source of moral evil? <i>or</i>, on the contrary, to regard
it as in no sense whatever willed by the Supreme Mind, and
absolutely inimical to his Providence? Are we most in harmony
with the characteristic spirit of the Gospel when we
call sin his instrument, or when we call it his enemy? For
myself, I can never sit at the feet of Jesus, and yield up a
reverential heart to his great lessons, without casting myself
on the persuasion, that God and evil are everlasting foes;
that never, and for no end, did he create it; that his will is
utterly against it, nor ever touches it, but with annihilating
force. Any other view appears to be injurious to the characteristic
sentiments, and at variance with the distinguishing
genius, of Christian morality.</p>

<p>(1.) Christianity is distinguished by the profound sentiment
of <i>individual responsibility</i> which pervades it. All the
arbitrary forms, and sacerdotal interpositions, and hereditary
rights, through which other systems seek the Divine favor,
are disowned by it. It is a religion eminently <i>personal</i>; establishing
the most intimate and solitary dealings between
God and every human soul. It is a religion eminently
<i>natural</i>; eradicating no indigenous affection of our mind,
distorting no primitive moral sentiment; but simply consecrating
the obligations proper to our nature, and taking up
with a divine voice the whispers, scarce articulate before, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
the conscience within us. In this deep harmony with our
inmost consciousness of duty resides the true power of our
religion. It subdues and governs our hearts, as a wise conqueror
rules the empire he has won; not by imposing a system
of strange laws, but by arming with higher authority,
and administering with more resolute precision, the laws
already recognized and revered.</p>

<p>To trifle in any way with this plain and solemn principle,
to invent forms of speech tending to conceal it, to apply to
moral good and ill language which assimilates them to physical
objects and exchangeable property, implies frivolous and
irreverent ideas of sin and excellence. The whole weight
of this charge evidently falls on the scheme which speaks of
human guilt as an hereditary entail; a scheme which shocks
and confounds our primary notion of right and wrong, and,
by rendering them impersonal qualities, reduces them to
empty names. No construction can be given to the system,
which does not pass this insult on the conscience. In what
sense do we share the guilt of our progenitor? His concession
to temptation did not occur within our mind, or belong
in any way to our history. And if, without participation in
the <i>act</i> of wrong, we are to have its <i>penalties</i>, crimes in
the planet Saturn may be expected to shower curses on the
earth; for why may not justice go astray in space, as reasonably
as in time? If nothing more be meant, than that
from our first parents we inherit a constitution <i>liable</i> to intellectual
error and moral transgression,&mdash;still it is evident
that, <i>until</i> this liability takes actual effect, no sin exists, but
only its possibility; and <i>when</i> it takes effect, there is just so
much guilt, and no more, than might be committed by the
individual's will: so that where there is <i>no</i> volition, as in
infancy, cruelty only could inflict punishment; and where
there is <i>pure</i> volition, as in many a good passage of the
foulest life, equity itself could not withhold approval.</p>

<p>(2.) I submit as a second distinguishing feature of practical
Christianity, that it makes no great, certainly no exclusive,
appeal to the <i>prudential feelings</i>, as instruments of duty;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
treats them as morally incapable of so sacred a work; and
relies, chiefly and characteristically, on affections of the heart,
which no motives of reward and punishment can have the
smallest tendency to excite.</p>

<p>The Gospel, indeed, like all things divine, is unsystematic
and unbound by technical distinctions, and makes no metaphysical
separation between the will and the affections. It is
too profoundly adapted to our nature, not to address itself
copiously to both. The doctrine of retribution, being a solemn
truth, appears with all its native force in the teachings of
Christ, and arms many of his appeals with a persuasion just
and terrible. But never was there a religion (containing
these motives at all) so frugal in the use of them; so able, on
fit occasions, to dispense with them; so rich in those inimitable
touches of moral beauty, and tones that penetrate the
conscience, and generous trust in the better sympathies, which
distinguish a morality of the affections. In Christ himself,
where is there a trace of the obedience of pious self-interest,
computing its everlasting gains, and making out a case for
compensation, by submitting to infinite wisdom? In his
character, which is the impersonation of his religion, we surely
have a perfect image of spontaneous goodness, unhaunted by
the idea of personal enjoyment, and, like that of God, unbidden
but by the intuitions of conscience and the impulses
of love. And what teacher less divine ever made such high
and bold demands on our disinterestedness? To lend out our
virtue upon interest, to "love them only who love us," he
pronounced to be the sinners' morality; nor was the feeling of
duty ever reached, but by those who could "do good, hoping
for <i>nothing</i> again," except that greatest of rewards to a true
and faithful heart, to be "the children of the Highest," who
"is kind unto the unthankful and the evil." In the view of
Jesus, all dealings between God and men were not of bargain,
but of affection. We must surrender ourselves to him without
terms; must be ashamed to doubt him who feeds the birds
of the air, and, like the lily of the field, look up to him with a
bright and loving eye; and he, for our much love, will pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
and forgive us. In his own ministry, how much less did our
Lord rely for disciples on the cogency of mere proof, and the
inducements of hope and fear, than on the power of moral
sympathy, by which every one that was of God naturally
loved him and heard his words; by which the good shepherd
knew his sheep, and they listened to his voice, and followed
him; and without which no man could come unto him, for
no spirit of the Father drew him. No condition of discipleship
did Christ impose, save that of "faith in him";
absolute trust in the spirit of his mind; a desire of self-abandonment
to a love and fidelity like his, without tampering
with expediency, or hesitancy in peril, or shrinking
from death.</p>

<p>There is, then, a wide variance between the genius of
Christianity, and that philosophy which teaches that all men
must be bought over to the side of goodness and of God, by
a price suited to their particular form of selfishness and appetite
for pleasure. Our religion is remarkable for the large
confidence it reposes on the disinterested affections, and the
vast proportion of the work of life it consigns to them. And
in thus seeking to subordinate and tranquillize the prudential
feelings, Christ manifested how well he knew what was in
man. He recognized the truth, which all experience declares,
that in these emotions is nothing great, nothing lovable, nothing
powerful; that their energy is perpetually found incapable
of withstanding the impetuosity of passion; and that
all transcendent virtues, all that brings us to tremble or to
kneel, all the enterprises and conflicts which dignify history,
and have stamped any new feature on human life, have had
their origin in the disinterested region of the mind,&mdash;in affections
unconsciously entranced by some object sanctifying and
divine. He knew, for it was his special mission to make all
men feel, that it is the office of true religion to cleanse the
sanctuary of the secret affections, and effect a regeneration
of the heart. And this is a task which no direct <i>nisus</i> of the
will can possibly accomplish, and to which, therefore, all
offers of reward and punishment, operating only on the will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
are quite inapplicable. The single function of volition is <i>to
act</i>; over the executive part of our nature it is supreme, over
the emotional it is powerless; and all the wrestlings of desire
for self-cure and self-elevation, are like the struggles of a child
to lift himself. He who is anxious to be a philanthropist, is
admiring benevolence, instead of loving men; and whoever is
laboring to warm his devotions, yearns after piety, not after
God. The mind can by no spasmodic bound seize on a new
height of emotion, or change the light in which objects appear
before its view. Persuade the judgment, bribe the self-interests,
terrify the expectations, as you will, you can neither
dislodge a favorite, nor enthrone a stranger, in the heart.
Show me a child that flings an affectionate arm around a
parent, and lights up his eyes beneath her face, and I know
that there have been no lectures there upon filial love; but
that the mother, being lovable, has <i>of necessity</i> been loved; for
to genial minds it is as impossible to withhold a pure affection,
when its object is presented, as for the flower to sulk
within the mould, and clasp itself tight within the bud, when
the gentle force of spring invites its petals to curl out into
the warm light. As you reverence all good affections of our
nature, and desire to awaken them, never call them duties,
though they be so; for so doing, you address yourself to the
will; and by hard trying no attachment ever entered the
heart. Never preach on their great desirableness and propriety;
for so doing, you ask audience of the judgment; and
by way of the understanding no glow of noble passion ever
came. Never, above all, reckon up their balance of good
and ill; for so doing, you exhort self-interest; and by that
soiled way no true love will consent to pass. Nay, never
talk of them, nor even gaze curiously at them; for if they
be of any worth and delicacy, they will be instantly looked
out of countenance and fly. Nothing worthy of human veneration
will condescend to be embraced, but for its own sake:
grasp it for its excellent results,&mdash;make but the faintest offer
to use it as a tool, and it slips away at the very conception of
such insult. The functions of a healthy body go on, not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
knowledge of physiology, but by the instinctive vigor of
nature; and you will no more brace the spiritual faculties to
noble energy and true life by study of the uses of every
feeling, than you can train an athlete for the race by lectures
on every muscle of every limb. The mind is not voluntarily
active in the acquisition of any great idea, any new inspiration
of faith; but passive, fixed on the object which has
dawned upon it, and filled it with fresh light.</p>

<p>If this be true, and if it be the object of practical Christianity,
not only to direct our hands aright, but to inspire our
hearts, then can its ends never be achieved by the mere force
of reward and punishment; then no system can prove its
sufficiency by showing that it retains the doctrine of retribution,
and must even be held convicted of moral incompetency,
if it trusts the conscience mainly to the prudential feelings,
without due provision for enlisting the co-operation of many
a disinterested affection.</p>

<p>We cannot refrain from affording those into whose
hands this volume will go, the pleasure and the lofty
encouragement which they must derive from the perusal
of an extract on</p>


<h4>THE TRANSMISSION OF SUPERIOR THOUGHTS.</h4>

<p>It is a law of Providence in communities, that ideas shall
be propagated downwards through the several gradations of
minds. They have their origin in the suggestions of genius,
and the meditations of philosophy; they are assimilated by
those who can admire what is great and true, but cannot
originate; and thence they are slowly infused into the popular
mind. The rapidity of the process may vary in different
times, with the facilities for the transmission of thought, but
its order is constant. Temporary causes may shield the
inferior ranks of intelligence from the influence of the superior;
fanaticism may interpose for a while with success; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
want of the true spirit of sympathy between the instructors
and the instructed may check by a moral repulsion the
natural radiation of intellect;&mdash;but, in the end, Providence
will re-assert its rule; and the conceptions born in the quiet
heights of contemplation will precipitate themselves on the
busy multitudes below. This principle interprets history and
presages futurity. It shows us in the popular feeling and
traditions of one age, a reflection from the philosophy of a
preceding; and from the prevailing style of sentiment and
speculation among the cultivated classes now, it enables us to
foresee the spirit of a coming age. Nor only to foresee it, but
to exercise over it a power, in the use of which there is a
grave responsibility. If we are far-sighted in our views of
improvement; if we are ambitious less of immediate and
superficial effects than of the final and deep-seated agency
of generous and holy principles; if our love of opinions is a
genuine expression of the disinterested love of truth;&mdash;we
shall remember who are the teachers of futurity; we shall
appeal to those, within whose closets God is already computing
the destinies of remote generations,&mdash;men at once erudite
and free, men who have the materials of knowledge with
which to determine the great problems of morals and religion,
and the genius to think and imagine and feel, without let or
hinderance of hope or fear.</p>

<p>We linger over the pages from which the preceding
selections have been made, unwilling to end our
grateful task of love. But one quotation more must
be the last. With it we commend these Studies of
Christianity, these timely thoughts for religious thinkers,
to the candid and affectionate inquirers within all
sects, confident that, so far as the work obtains a fit
reception, it will exert that purifying, liberalizing, and
sanctifying power which is the genuine influence of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHRISTIANITY AND SECTARIAN THEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>The sectarian state of theology in this country cannot but
be regarded as eminently unnatural. Its cold and hard ministrations
are entirely alien to the wants of the popular mind,
which, except under the discipline of artificial influences, is
always most awake to generous impressions. Its malignant
exclusiveness is a perversion of the natural veneration of the
human heart, which, except where it is interfered with by
narrow and selfish systems, pours itself out, not in hatred
towards anything that lives, but in love to the invisible objects
of trust and hope. Its disputatious trifling is an insult
to the sanctity of conscience, which, except where it is
betrayed into oblivion of its delicate and holy office, supplicates
of religion, not a new ferocity of dogmatism, but an
enlargement and refinement of its sense of right. It is the
temper of sectarianism to seize on every deformity of every
creed, and exhibit this caricature to the world's gaze and
aversion. It is the spirit of the soul's natural piety to alight
on whatever is beautiful and touching in every faith, and
take there its secret draught of pure and fresh emotion. It is
the passages of poetry and pathos in a system, which alone
can lay a strong hold on the general mind and give them
permanence; and even the wild fictions which have endeared
Romanism to the hearts of so many centuries, possess their
elements of tenderness and magnificence. The fundamental
principle of one who would administer religion to the minds
of his fellow-men should be, that all that has ever been
extensively venerated must possess ingredients that are venerable.
If, in the spirit of sectarianism, he sees nothing in it
but absurdity, it only proves that he does not see it all; it
must have an aspect, which he has not yet caught, that
awes the imagination, or touches the affections, or moves the
conscience; and those who receive it neither will nor should
abandon it, till something is substituted, not only more consonant
with the reason, but more awakening to these higher
faculties of soul. Hence, a rigid accuracy and logical penetration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
of mind, the power of detecting and exposing error,
are not the only qualities needed by the religious reformer;
and in a deep and reverential sympathy with human feelings,
a quick perception of the great and beautiful, a promptitude
to cast himself into the minds of others, and gaze through
their eyes at the objects which they love, he will find the
instrument of the sublimest intellectual power. The precise
logician may sit eternally in the centre of his own circle of
correct ideas, and preach demonstrably the folly of the
world's superstitions; yet he will never affect the thoughts of
any but marble-minded beings like himself. He disregards
the fine tissue of emotions that clings round the objects which
he so harshly handles; and has yet to learn the art of preserving
its fabric unimpaired, while he enfolds within it something
more worthy for it to foster and adore.</p>

<p>As, then, it is to the moral and imaginative powers of the
human mind that religion chiefly attaches itself, as it is by
these that the want of it is most strongly felt, so is it to these
that its ministrations should be, for the most part, addressed.
While theologians are discussing the evidences of creeds, let
teachers be conducting them to their applications. Let their
respective resources of feeling and conception be unfolded
before the soul of mankind; let it be tried what mental energy
they can inspire, what purity of moral perception infuse,
what dignity of principle erect, what toils of philanthropy
sustain. Thus would arise a new criterion of judgment between
differing systems; for that system must possess most
truth which creates the most intelligence and virtue. Thus
would the deeper devotional wants of society be no longer
mocked by the privilege of choice among a few captious,
verbal, and precise forms of belief. Thus, too, would the
alienation which repels sect from sect give place to an incipient
and growing sympathy; for when high intellect and
excellence approach and stand in meek homage beneath the
cross, how soon are the jarring voices of disputants hushed in
the stillness of reverence! Who does not feel the refreshment,
when some stream of pure poetry, like Heber's, winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
into the desert of theology! when some flash of genius, like
that of Chalmers, darts through its dull atmosphere! some
strains of eloquence, like those of Channing, float from a distance
on its heavy silence!</p>

<p>Such, then, are the objects which should be contemplated
by those who, in the present times, aim at the reformation of
religious sentiment;&mdash;first, the elevation of theology as an
intellectual pursuit; secondly, the better application of religion
as a moral influence. Both these objects are directly
or indirectly promoted by the Association whose cause I am
privileged to advocate. It aids the first, by the distribution
of many a work, the production of such minds as must redeem
theology from contempt. It advances the second, by establishing
union and sympathy among those whose first principles
are in direct contradiction to all that is sectarian, and who
desire only to emancipate the understanding from all that enfeebles,
and the heart from all that narrows it. The triumph
of its doctrines would be, not the ascendency of one sect, but
the harmony of all. Let but the diversities which separate
Christians retire, and the truths which they all profess to love
advance to prominence, and, whatever may become of party
names, our aims are fulfilled, and our satisfaction is complete.
When faith in the paternity of God shall have kindled an
affectionate and lofty devotion; when the vision of immortality,
imparted by Christ's resurrection, shall have created
that spirit of duty which was the holiest inspiration of his
life; when the sincere recognition of human brotherhood shall
have supplanted all exclusive institutions, and banded society
together under the vow of mutual aid and the hope of everlasting
progress, our work will be done, our reward before
us, and our little community of reformers lost in the wide
fraternity of enlightened and benevolent men.</p>

<p>The day is yet distant, and can be won only by the toil of
earnest and faithful minds. In the mean while, it is no light
solace to see that the tendencies of Providence are towards
its accelerated approach. And however dispiriting may
sometimes be the variety and conflicts of human sentiment,&mdash;however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
remote the dissonance of controversy from that harmony
of will which would seem essential to perfected society,
it is through this very process that the great ends of improvement
are to be attained. Hereafter it will be seen, much
more clearly than we can see it now, that opinion generates
knowledge. Like the ethereal waves, whose inconceivable
rapidity and number are said to impart the sensation of vision,
the undulations of opinion are speeding on to produce
the perception of truth. They are the infinitely complex and
delicate movements of that universal Human Mind, whose
quiescence is darkness,&mdash;whose agitation, light.</p>

<p>To the fit and numerous readers whom we trust
they will find, these papers are now submitted, in the
earnest hope that the author will at no distant day
follow them with some more systematic and rounded
survey of the same great subject,&mdash;the components
and developments of Christianity.</p>

<p>If unity be the character of truth, no generation was ever
so far gone in errors as our own: nor is the weariness surprising,
with which statesmen and philosophers turn away
from the Babel of Divinity, and, in despair of scaling the
heavens, apply themselves to found and adorn the politics of
this world. But the confusion of tongues is too positive and
obtrusive a fact to be escaped by mere retreat: it bids defiance
to polite evasion: it pursues life into every public place
and private haunt; invades the home, the school, the college,
the court, the legislature; and, besides the problems which it
fails to solve, constitutes in itself a new one, not undeserving
the closest study and reflection. To the believers in doctrinal
finality, who imagine the whole sacred economy to be settled
by a documentary revelation, the reopening of every question,
down to the very basis of religious faith, must be an appalling
phenomenon, charging either failure on the presumed designs
of God or a traitorous perversity on even the most gifted and
upright of men. And not a whit better is the conclusion of a
conceited illuminism, which, either boldly recalling the human
mind to the sciences of induction, despises all faith as false
alike; or, conscious at least of its own incompetency, pleases
itself with a more indulgent scepticism, and accepts them all
as true. If no better revenge can be taken on pious dogmatism
than by falling into the cant of an eclectic neutrality or
an impious despair, there is little encouragement for any high-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
man to take part against the bigotries of the present
on behalf of sickly negations in the future. The world is better
left in the hands of the poorest interpreter of Paul, and
most degenerate heirs of Augustine and Pascal, than transferred
to the dialectic of Proclus or the materialism of the living
"<i>Fondateur de la Religion de l'Humanité</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There are
those, however, who deny that we are left to any such alternative;
who cannot conceive that human aspirations after
divine reality shall for ever pine and sigh in vain; who contend
that objective truth in reference to morals and religion
is attainable, and has been largely attained;&mdash;and who, accordingly,
despairing of neither philosophy nor Christianity,
require only the free intercommunion of the two to appreciate
the contradictions of the present without foregoing the hope
of greater unity in the future. The controversies of the hour
are but ill understood by one who remains enclosed within
them, and judges them only on their own assumptions. Like
a village brawl, which, with only the sound of vulgar noise,
may be the ripe fruit of oppression and the germ of revolution,
they have an assigned place in the unfolding of modern
civilization; and not till their place is computed in the life of
the human race, and the law which brings them up in our age
is observed, can their real significance be apprehended, and
all anger at their clamorous littleness be lost in hope of their
ulterior issues. Regarded from this higher point, the surface
of religious belief in England, at first sight a mere troubled
fermentation of struggling elements, betrays some organic
principle of order, and many salient points of promise.</p>

<p>We hazard no theory of religion in saying that there is a
natural correspondence between the genius of a people and
the form of their belief. Each mood of mind brings its own
wants and aspirations, colors its own ideal, and interprets best
that part of life and the universe with which it is in sympathy.
John Knox would have been misplaced in Athens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Tanler could not have lived on the moralism of Kant. No
doubt the ultimate seat of human faith lies deep down below
the special propensities of individuals or tribes,&mdash;in a consciousness
and faculty common to the race. But ere it comes
to the surface, and disengages itself in a concrete shape, its
type and color will be affected by the strata of thought and
feeling through which it emerges into the light. Without pretending
to an exhaustive classification, we find four chief temperaments
of mind expressed in the theologies and scepticisms
of civilized Europe: the quest of physical <i>order</i>, the sense
of <i>right</i>, the instinct of <i>beauty</i>, and the consciousness of tempestuous
<i>impulses</i> carrying the will off its feet. Variously
blended in the characters of average persons, these tendencies
are liable to separate their intensities, and severally dominate
almost alone in minds of great force and periods of special
action or reaction. Were each left to itself to form its own
unaided creed, the doctrine of mere Science would be <i>atheistic</i>;
of Conscience, <i>theistic</i>; of Art, <i>pantheistic</i>; of Passion,
<i>sacrificial</i>. The evidence of this distribution of tendencies is
equally conclusive, whether we look to its rational ground or
to its historical exemplification; and a few words on each
head will suffice to clear and justify it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding some occasional attempts to exhibit natural
theology as a necessary extension of natural philosophy, it
is plain that the maxims, which are ultimate for physical Science,
stop short of contact with Religion; that the final appeal
of the two is carried to different faculties; and that the scope
and sphere of the one may be complete without borrowing any
conception from the other. The assumption, for instance, that
"we can know nothing but <i>phenomena</i>," directly excludes all
permanent and eternal Being as the possible object of rational
thought. And as "phenomena" are apprehensible only by
the <i>observing</i> faculties, whatever refuses to put in an appearance
in <i>their</i> court is nonsuited as an unreality. And again,
physical knowledge has accomplished its aim, as soon as it can
predict all the successions that lie within its field of time and
space; and nowhere in this system of series, nor in the calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
forces which yield it to the view, does any divine <i>Person</i>
look in upon the mind. Whoever, by the restraints of a hypothetical
necessity, detains his intellect <i>within</i> nature, debars
himself <i>ipso facto</i> from any faith that <i>transcends</i> nature, and
recognizes no reserve of <i>super</i>natural possibilities, hidden in a
Mind of which the actual universe is but the finite expression.
We do not, of course, intend to affirm that scientific culture
cannot coexist with religious belief;&mdash;so preposterous an assertion
would be confuted by a manifold experience;&mdash;but
only that, where the canons of inductive knowledge are invested
with unconditional universality, and are logically carried
out as valid for all thought, they shut the door upon the
sources of faith. It is the old battle, of which history supplies
such abundant illustration; which brought Parmenides and
Protagoras upon the lists at opposite ends on the field of philosophy;
which Bacon profoundly avoided by assigning separate
empires, without common boundary, to science and religion;
but which his modern disciples have rashly renewed, by
invading the realm left sacred by him. Uneasy relations
have always subsisted in Christendom between the investigators
of nature and the trustees of the faith: the men of science
rarely quitting, unless for signs of unequivocal aversion, the
attitude of polite indifference to the Church; and in their turn
watched with the jealous eye of sacerdotal vigilance. It is no
untrue instinct that has hitherto maintained them in this posture
of mutual suspicion: to exchange which for a hearty and
intelligent reverence for each other is an achievement reserved
for a higher philosophy than we yet possess.</p>

<p>As Science pays homage to the <i>force of nature</i>, so Conscience
enthrones the <i>law of right</i>. The conscious subject of
moral obligation feels himself under a rule neither self-imposed
and fictitious, nor foreign and coercive;&mdash;neither a
home invention nor an outward necessity;&mdash;a rule invisible,
authoritative, awful; carrying with it an <i>alternative</i> irreducible
to the linear dynamics of the physical world; incapable of
being felt but by a free mind, or of being given but by another.
He is aware that his will follows a call of duty not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
all as his body adapts itself to the force of gravitation; and as
within him the conscientious obedience wholly differs from the
corporeal, so in the universe of realities beyond him does the
moral legislation differ from the natural, and express the will
of a person, not a mere constitution of things. No ethical
conceptions are possible at all,&mdash;except as floating shreds of
unattached thought,&mdash;without a religious background; and
the sense of responsibility, the agony of shame, the inner reverence
for justice, first find their meaning and vindication in a
supreme holiness that rules the world. Nor can any one be
penetrated with the distinction between right and wrong, without
recognizing it as valid for all free beings, and incapable of
local or arbitrary change. His feeling insists on its permanent
recognition and omnipresent sway; and this unity in the
Moral Law carries him to the unity of the Divine Legislator.
Theism is thus the indispensable postulate of conscience,&mdash;its
objective counterpart and justification, without which its
inspirations would be illusions, and its veracities themselves a
lie. To adduce historical proofs of this conjunction is at once
difficult and superfluous in a world whose theism is almost all
of one stock. But it will not be forgotten that Socrates, in
whom Greek religion culminated, avowedly based his reform
on the substitution of moral for physical studies. It is undeniable
too that, in spite of their fatalism, the monotheistic Mohammedans
have been surpassed by few nations in their sense
of truth and fidelity; and that wherever the same type of belief
has been approached by Christian sects, the heresy has
been said to arise from an exaggerated estimate of the moral
law.</p>

<p>Art, we have said, is <i>pantheistic</i>. Its aim, often unconsciously
present, is to read off the <i>expressiveness</i> of things,
and find what it is which they would speak with their silent
look. To its perceptions, form, color, sound, motion, have
a soul within them whose life and activity they represent:
and even language, by flinging itself into the mould of rhythm
and music, acquires, beyond its logical significance, a second
meaning for the affections. As if waked up and tingling beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the artist's loving gaze, matter lies dull and dead no
more; opens on him a responding eye; communes with him
from its steadfast brow; and becomes instinct with grace or
majesty. Instead of being the drag-weight and opposite of
spiritual energies, it becomes to him their pliant medium, the
docile clay for the shapes of finest thought, the brilliant palette
for the spread of inmost feeling. He melts the barrier
away that hides from mere sense and intellect the interior
sentiment&mdash;the formative idea&mdash;of all visible things; and
his glance of sympathy changes them not less than a burst of
amber sunrise changes a leaden landscape and picks out the
freshest smiles. Thus he finds himself in a <i>living</i> universe,
ever striving to show him a divine beauty that lurks within
and presses to the surface; and he stands before a curtain
only half opaque, watching the lights and shadows thrown on
it from behind by the ceaseless play of infinite thought. Not
that the interpretation is by any means self-evident, or accessible
except to the apprehensive instinct of sympathy. For
it seems as though no form of being, no object in creation,
could ever represent completely its own type: something is
lost from its perfection in the realization; and the actual,
falling short of the ideal, can give it only to one for whom a
hint suffices. This conception of the world as an incarnate
divineness does not, we are well aware, amount to pantheism,
unless it become all-comprehensive, so as to take in not simply
physical nature, but the human life and will; and there are
numbers who are saved from this extreme, either by knowing
where to draw the lines of philosophical distinction, or by the
natural force of <i>moral</i> conviction restraining the absolutism of
imagination. But so far forth as the tendency operates, it
substitutes for the theistic reverence for a Holy <i>Will</i> the pantheistic
recognition of a Creative <i>Beauty</i>, and presents God
to the mind less as the prototype of Conscience than as the
apotheosis of Genius. The spontaneity of poetic action is
supposed to illustrate His procedure better than the preferential
decisions of the moral sentiment; and the genesis of whatever
is good and fair is referred not so much to deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
plan as to the eternal interfusion and circulation, through the
great whole, of a Divine Essence, which flings off the universe
and its history as a mere natural language. That this is the
religion of art, is proved by the literature of every creative period,
Greek, Italian, or Teutonic; and negatively by the comparative
absence of artistic feeling and production in ages and
nations that have most intensified at once the Unity and the
Personality of God. Beauty was the Bible of Athens; and
Plato, its devoutest and most comprehensive expounder, shows
everywhere, in his metaphysics, his morals, and his myths, the
mould into which its faith inevitably falls.</p>

<p>In <i>passionate and impulsive</i> natures there is a self-contradiction
which makes their religious tendency peculiarly difficult
to describe. They are not less conscious than others of
moral distinctions, and own the sacred authority of the better
invitation over the worse. Indeed, when surprised into a
fall, their remorse shares the vehemence of all their emotions,
and from the black shadow in which they sit, the sanctity of
the law which they have violated looks ineffably bright; and
they speak of its holy requirements, and of the infinite purity
of the Divine Legislator, in such fervid tone, that whatever
else they may endanger, the perfection of God's character,
you feel assured, and the obligations of human morality, are
secure of reverential maintenance. Yet the truth is precisely
the reverse. At the very moment that the law of duty is
thus loftily extolled, it is on the point of total subversion; lifted
to a height precarious and unreal, it overbalances on the
other side and disappears. For the very same stormy intensity
which makes these men strong to feel the claim of good,
makes them weak to obey it. Their personality wants solidity;
and an atmosphere of tempestuous affections sweeps over
it like a hurricane on water. They can do nothing from out
of their own resolves, and are for ever drawn or driven from
the fortress they were not to surrender. What remains for
them, solicited thus by forces which are an overmatch for their
just self-reliance? Is it surprising that they no sooner confess
how they <i>ought</i> to obey, than they declare that they <i>cannot</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
obey? The thing is a contradiction; but it all the better for
this expresses what <i>they</i> are: with their centre of gravity in
the wrong place, they cannot but hold the truth in unstable
equilibrium. Repose on contradiction is, however, impossible;
and the necessary result of these co-existent feelings of
obligation and incapacity is a <i>substitute</i> for obedience. The
resort to <i>sacrifice</i> which thus arose expressed no more, prior
to the Christian era, than the sentiment, "Take this, O
Lord, 't is all I have to give"; and afforded but a fictitious relief
to the laboring spirit. It acknowledged and attested the
incompetency of the will, but made no use of the excess of
the emotions. It was the Pauline doctrine of faith which first
turned this great power to account; and virtually said, "Are
you in slavery because you cannot manage your affections?
turn their trust and enthusiasm on Christ in heaven, and let
them <i>manage</i> you, and you shall be free." The soul that falls
in love with immortal goodness rises above the region of ineffectual
strife, and spontaneously offers what could never be
extorted from the will by the lash of self-mortifying resolve.
This is the truth which underlies the sacrificial doctrine in
Christian times,&mdash;<i>the emancipating power of great trusts and
high inspirations</i>; and its very nature indicates its birth from
impassioned temperaments, and its affinity with their special
wants. The vicarious sacrifice is a mere plea, an ideal point
of attraction, for a profound allegiance of heart; which minds
of this class would hardly yield without an intense appeal to
their <i>gratitude</i>; but which, if really awakened by a clear and
tranquil moral reverence, would no less triumph over the
gravitation of self. The one needful condition for the redemption
of these natures is the objective presence and action
upon them of a divine person to lift them clear out of themselves,
and render back on the healing breath of trust the
strength that only pants itself away in feverish effort. Every
doctrine of sacrifice necessarily contradicts its own premises;
because for guilt, which is personal and inalienable, it offers
a compensation which is foreign, and meets a moral ill with
an unmoral remedy. True and sound as a mere confession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
weakness, it runs off from that point into mere confusion and
morbidness. But add to it the doctrine of faith, and it acquires
its proper complement; balances its human disclaimer
with a divine resource; and instead of sending its captive
through dark labyrinths of vain experiment, opens a direct
way from the chambers of humiliation to the prophet's watch-tower
of prayer and vision. Without this complement, the
doctrine created priesthoods; with it, destroys them. Without
it, men are caught up in their moments of helplessness,
and handed over to ritual quackeries; with it, they are seized
in their hour of inspiration, and flung into the arms of God.
The susceptibility for either treatment depends on the predominance
of impulse and passion over breadth of imagination
and strength of will. In short, there are minds whose power
is shed, if we may say so, in <i>pro</i>tension, precipitated forwards
in narrow channels with impetuous torrent. There are others
whose affluence is in <i>ex</i>tension, and spreads out like a still lake
to drink in light from the open sky, and reflect the look of
wide-encircling hills. And there are others yet again, whose
character is <i>in</i>tension, and that move on in full volume, and
with steady stream of tendency, rising and falling little with
the seasons, and holding to the limits within which they are
to go. The faith of the first is <i>sacrificial</i>; of the second,
<i>pantheistic</i>; of the third, <i>theistic</i>.</p>

<p>Of the four cardinal tendencies we have named, the <i>scientific</i>
has never been provided for within the interior of Christianity;
whose organic life and structure are complete without
it. It remains, therefore, sullenly on the outside, without renouncing
at present its atheistic propensions: and the part it
has played, however important, has been that of external
check and antagonism, in the assertion of neglected rights of
knowledge, and slighted interests of mankind. This cannot
possibly continue for ever; nor is it at all consistent with experience
to suppose, that either of the opponent influences
will obtain a victory over the other. Their reconcilement,
through the mediation and within the compass of some third
and more comprehensive conception, is a task remaining for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the philosophy and charity of the future. We feel no doubt
that it will be accomplished; and will spare us that revolutionary
extermination of theology and metaphysics which is proclaimed,
on behalf of positive science, by the self-appointed
Committee of the "République Occidentale." The other three
tendencies early worked their way into the Christian religion,
and vindicated a place within its organism. Indeed, the historical
genesis of the Catholic Church consists of little else,
on the inner side of dogma and ethics, than the successive and
successful self-assertion of each of these principles; and, on
the outer side of ecclesiastical polity, than the construction of
a social framework which held them in co-existence till the
sixteenth century. The genius of three distinct peoples conspired
to fill up the measure of the early faith; and each
brought with it a separate constituent. The Hebrew believer
contributed his theistic conscience; the Hellenic, his pantheistic
speculation; the Romanic, his passionate appropriation
of redemption by faith. The elements were, from the first,
mixed and struggling together; so that the phenomena of no
period, probably of no place, serve to show them disengaged
from one another and insulated. But the Ebionitish period,
with its rigorous monachism, its historical and human
Christ, its scrupulous asceticism, its sternness against wealth,
represents the <i>ethical</i> principle in its excess. The Logos idea,
and indeed the whole development of the Trinitarian doctrine,
exhibits the effort of the <i>Greek</i> thought to obtain recognition,
and qualify the Judaic. And the <i>Augustinian</i> theology,
pleading the wants of fervid natures, on whose surface the
web of moral doctrines alights only to be shrivelled and disappear,
completes the triad of agencies from whose confluence
the faith of Christendom arose. In the Catholic system the
three ingredients unite in one composite result; and hence the
tenacity with which that system keeps possession of the most
various types of human character, and, baffled by the spirit
of one age, returns with the reaction of another. The ethical
feeling finds satisfaction in its theory of human nature; the
pantheistic, in its scheme of supernatural grace; the sacrificial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in its conditions of redemption. Through the realism of
the mediæval schools, its eucharistic doctrine, which is only
the theological side of that philosophical conception, becomes a
direct transfusion of Hellenic influence into the Church. And
its faith in perpetual inspiration, in the unbroken chain of
physical miracle, in the ceaseless mingling of sacramental
mystery with the very substance of this world, so far softens
and diffuses the concentrated personality of the Divine Essence,
as to indulge the free fancy of art. Nor can we deny
the same capacity of beauty to its hierarchy of holy natures,&mdash;from
the village saint, through the heavenly angels, to the
Son of God,&mdash;all blended in living sympathies that cross and
recross the barriers of worlds. This comprehensive adaptation
to the exigencies of mankind is a reasonable object of
admiration. But nothing can be more absurd than the appeal
to it in proof either of preternatural guidance, or of human
artifice, in the constitutive process of the Roman Church.
There is nothing very surprising in the fact, that a system
which is the product of three factors should contain them all.
No doubt if these factors are, as we contend, primary and
indestructible features of our unperverted nature, no religion
can be divine and completely true which refuses to take any
of them up; and this <i>one</i> condition of the future faith we may
learn from the Christendom of the past. The condition, however,
must be satisfied otherwise than by the strange congeries
of profound truths and puerile fancies which is dignified by
the name of "Catholic doctrine."</p>

<p>For, be it observed, this system has no intrinsic and necessary
unity, which would hold it together when abandoned to the
free action of the mind, whose requirements it is said to meet.
It has something for conscience, something for art, something for
passion, each in its turn; but it is not a whole that can satisfy
all together. Its contents, gathered by successive experiences,
cohere through the external grasp of a sacerdotal corporation;
and if that hand be paralyzed or relaxed, it becomes evident at
once how little they have grown together. Hence the phenomena
of the sixteenth century, whose revolt was the expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not of theological dissent, but of ecclesiastical disgust; and in
which doctrine only accidentally fell to pieces, because the
authority that guarded and wielded it became too rotten to be
believed in. The secondary revolution, however, was incomparably
more momentous than the primary. The treasured
seeds that dropped from the shattered casket of the Church
had to germinate again in the fresh soil of the richer European
mind; and the great year of their development is still
upon its round. The outward dictation of the Apostolic See
being discarded, it became necessary to find another clew to
divine truth; and the inner wants of the human soul and the
passing age came into play, with no restraint within the
ample scope of Scripture. A reconstitution of Christianity
began,&mdash;on the basis, no doubt, of materials already accumulated,&mdash;more
eclectic, therefore, and less creative, than in the
infancy of the religion; but proceeding, nevertheless, by the
same law, and commencing a similar cycle. The <i>order</i> of
development in this second life of Christendom has not been
the same as in the first; but the stages, though transposed,
do not differ taken one by one. It is only this,&mdash;that whilst
in the formation of the faith the dominant influences were
Conscience, Art, and Passion, in its Re-formation they are
Passion, Conscience, Art. At the moment when Luther shattered
the fabric of pretended unity, and compelled the husk to
shed its kernels, the season and the field were unfavorable to
two out of the three, and they lay dormant till more genial
times. The <i>moral</i> element had been discredited by the casuistry
of the confessional, the "treasure of the Church," and the
trade in meritorious works; and, decked in these vile trappings,
was flung away in generous disgust. The <i>æsthetic</i> element
had become so paganized in Italy, and was so identified
with the reproduction of the very tastes and vices, the thought
and style, nay, even the mythology itself, which the primitive
religion had expelled as the work of demons, that the new
piety shrank from it, and let it alone. In an age when episcopates
were won by an ear for hexameters or a Ciceronian
Latinity, when priests defended materialism in Tusculan disputations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
when popes frequented the comic theatre and Plautus
was acted in the Vatican, when the proceeds of a purgatorial
traffic were spent in destroying ancient basilicas and
raising heathenish temples over the sepulchres of saints, it was
inevitable that beauty should become suspected by sanctity.
There remained, yet unspoiled by the adoption of a corrupt
generation, the <i>impetuous</i> devotion and tremendous theory of
Augustine; and this, accordingly, was the direction in which
the whole early Reformation advanced. It was not the accident
that Luther was an Augustinian monk, which determined
the character of his movement. The sickened soul of Europe
could breathe no other air. Emaciated with the mockery of
spiritual aliment, revolting at the chopped straw and apples
of Sodom that had been given for fruit from the tree of life,
it sighed for escape from this choking discipline into some
region fresh with the mountain breath of faith and love, and
not quite barren of "angels' food." The burdened moral
sense, so long deluded and abused, reduced to self-conscious
dotage by vain penances and vainer promises, flung away all
belief in itself, asked leave to lay its freedom down, and went
into captivity to Christ. So exclusively did the feeling of
the time flow into this channel, that no doctrine which had an
ethical groundwork, or attempted to soften in the least the
implacable hostility of nature and grace, obtained any success;
while every enthusiastic excess of the anti-catholic ideas
spread like wildfire. The irreproachable innocence and piety
of the Salzburg <i>Gärtner-brüder</i> did nothing to save them
from quick martyrdom to their Ebionitish faith; while the
atrocities and ravings of the Anabaptists of Münster scarcely
sufficed to stop the triumph of their hideous kingdom of the
saints. The movement of the brave Zwingli, earlier and
more moderate than either Luther's or Calvin's, was easily
restrained by them within the narrowest range, whilst the
Genevan Reformer, cautious and ungenial, had but to collect
his logical fuel, and kindle the terrible fire of his dogma, and
it spread from the icy chambers of his own nature and wrapt
whole kingdoms in its flames. That men without passion or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
pathos themselves, who do their work by force of intellect
and will, should be successful disseminators of a doctrine that
can live in no cool air, only shows how wide was the preparation
of mind, and how the coming of this time fulfilled the
long desire of nations.</p>

<p>The first stage, then, of the new development of Christianity
was its <i>Puritan</i> period. The natural perdition of man,
the radical corruption of his will, the religious indifference of
all his states and actions, and the consequent worthlessness
of his morality, except for civil uses and social police, constitute
the fundamental assumptions of the system. From
this basis of despair its doctrine of atonement comes to the
rescue. The obedience of Christ is accepted in place of that
which men cannot render, and his sacrifice instead of the
penalty they deserve. Not, however, for all, but for those
alone who may appropriate the deliverance by an act of faith,
and present the merits of Christ as their offering to God, with
full assurance of their sufficiency. Nothing but a divine and
involuntary conversion can generate this faith, which follows
no predisposition from the antecedent life, but the inscrutable
decree of Heaven. Once transferred from the state of nature
into that of grace, the disciple becomes, through the Holy
Spirit, a new creature; is conscious of a sacred revolution in
his tastes and affections; gives evidence of this by good
works, which, now purified in their principle, are no longer
unacceptable to God; and knows that, though he is still
liable to the sins, he is redeemed from the penalties, of a son
of Adam. The Church is the body of the converted, and
while the Sacrament of Baptism initiates the candidate, and
provisionally secures him, the Communion seals his adoption
afterwards; the efficacy of both being conditional on the inner
faith of the participant. The intense and unmediated antithesis
of nature and grace, and the gulf, impassable except by
miracle, between their two spheres, may be regarded as the
most characteristic feature of this scheme. Its text-book
contains the Pauline Epistles, and opens most readily at the
Romans or Galatians; and its favorite writers are Augustine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Luther, Calvin, and Edwards. With vast internal differences
in their particular conceptions of Christian truth and of ecclesiastical
government, the so-called Evangelical sects retain the
impress of their common origin in the dearth of any ethical
or æsthetic element in their religion.</p>

<p>From this alone must have resulted the fact which a plurality
of causes has concurred in producing; viz. that the
Reformation soon (within a century and a half) reached its
apparent limit of extent, and propagated itself only internally
by further evolutions of thought. It had taken up and exhausted
the class of minds to which it was specially adapted;
and after appropriating these, found itself arrested. Under
the impulse of a newly-awakened piety men are disposed to
feel that they cannot attribute too much to God; and there
will always be large numbers who, from the absorbing intensity
of religious sentiment, or the dominance of predestinarian
theory, or the ill balance of partial cultivation, abdicate all
personal power of good in favor of irreversible decrees. But
as the tension relaxes or the culture enlarges, the moral instincts
reassert their existence; and the monstrous distortions
incident to any theory which denies their authority become
too repulsive to be borne. Hence a reaction, in which the
natural conscience takes the lead, and insists on obtaining that
reconciliation with God which has already been conquered for
the affections. Men in whom the sense of right and wrong
is deep cannot divest themselves of reverence for it as authoritative
and divine; nor can they truly profess that it is to
them an empty voice, which, venerable as it sounds, they are
never able to obey. They know what a difference it makes
to them, in the whole peace and power of their being, whether
they are faithful or whether they are false; that this difference
belongs alike to their state of nature and their state of
grace; that it is as little possible to withhold admiration from
the magnanimity of the Pagan Socrates as from that of the
Christian Paul; and that the sentiment which compels homage
to both is the same that looks up with trust and worship to the
justice and holiness of God: how, then, can they consent to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
an unreal line of impassable separation between ethical qualities
before conversion and the very same qualities after, and
abrogate in the one case the moral distinctions which become
valid in the other? The two lives,&mdash;of earth and heaven;
the two minds,&mdash;human and divine; the two states,&mdash;nature
and grace; which it is the impulse of enthusiasm to contrast,
it is the necessity of conscience to unite. When Luther first
blew up the sacerdotal bridge which had given a path across
to the steps of centuries, the boldness of the deed and the
inspiration of the time lightened the feet of men, and enabled
them to spring over with him on the wing of faith. But
when the van had passed, and the more equable and disciplined
ranks of another generation were brought to the
brink, there seemed a needless rashness in the attempt, and
foundations were discovered for a structure based on the rock
of nature, and making one province of both worlds. Even
Melancthon, long as he yielded to his leader's more powerful
will, could not permanently acquiesce in the complete extinction
of human responsibility; and vindicated for the soul a
voluntary co-operation with divine grace. This semi-Pelagian
example rapidly spread; first among the later Lutherans,
especially of Brunswick and Hanover; next into the school
of Leyden; and finally into the Church and universities of
England. Quick to seize the reaction in the temper of the
times, the Jesuits put themselves at the head of the same
tendency in their own communion; defended against the Jansenists
a doctrine of free-will beyond even the limits of Catholic
orthodoxy; upheld Molina against Augustine, as among
the Protestants Episcopius was gaining upon Calvin. Among
patriotic theologians the authority of the Latin Church gave
way in favor of the early Christian apologists and Greek
Fathers, who knew nothing of the scheme of decrees. Divinity,
under the guidance of More and Cudworth, no longer
disdained to replenish her oil and revive her flame from the
lamp of Athenian philosophy. And the conception of a universal
natural law was elaborately worked out by Grotius.
As the sixteenth century was the period of dogmatic theology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the seventeenth was that of ethical philosophy; the whole
modern history of which lies mainly within that limit and half
a century lower; and conclusively attests the decline of a
scheme of belief incompatible with the very existence of such
a science. When the Protestantism which had produced a
Farel, a Beza, and a Whitgift, offered as its representatives
Locke and Limborch, Tillotson and Butler, the nature of the
change which had come over it declares itself. It was the
revolt of moral sentiment against a doctrine that outraged it,&mdash;the
re-development, under new conditions, of the ethical
principle which had fallen neglected from the broken seed-vessel
of the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>The second season of the Reformation, though treated now
with unmerited disparagement, was not less worthy of admiration
than the first. High-Churchmen may be ashamed of an
archbishop who proposed a scheme of comprehension; Evangelicals,
of a preacher who applauded the Socinians; and
Coleridgians, of a theologian who was no deeper in metaphysics
than the "Grotian divines"; but neither the Erastianism,
the charity, nor the common sense of a Tillotson would be at
all unsuitable at this moment to a church openly torn by dissensions
and really held together only by dependence on the
state. It has been a current opinion, perseveringly propagated
by adherents of the Geneva theology, that the spread of
Arminian sentiments was equivalent to a religious decline,
and concurrent with the growth of a worldly laxity and selfish
indifference of character. The allegation is absolutely false.
In literature, in personal characteristics, and in public life, the
Latitude-men and their associates in belief bear honorable
comparison with their more rigorous forerunners. There is
not only less of passionate intolerance, but a nobler freedom
from an equivocal prudence, in the great writers of the second
period, than in the Reformers of the first: and there is more
to touch the springs of disinterestedness and elevation of mind
in Cudworth and Clarke than in Calvin and Beza. Nor did
the return of ethical theory weaken the sources of religious
action. The very enterprises in which evangelical zeal most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rejoices,&mdash;missions to the heathen, and the diffusion of the
Scriptures,&mdash;were not only prosecuted but set on foot in new
directions and with more powerful instrumentalities, in the
very midst of this period, and by the very labors of its most
distinguished philosophers. The Society for the Diffusion of
Christian Knowledge, and the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Foreign Parts, were both born with the eighteenth
century; and while the latter addressed itself to the
natives and slaves of the American provinces, the former first
made the Scriptures known on the Coromandel coast. It was
Boyle who, of all men of his age, displayed the most generous
zeal for the multiplication of the sacred writings, himself procuring
their translation into four or five languages. For thirty
years he was governor of a missionary corporation. Yet the
complexion of his theology is sufficiently indicated by the fact
that he bought up Pococke's Arabic translation of Grotius
(De Veritate Christianæ Religionis), and was at the cost of
its wide distribution in the East. And who that has ever
read it can forget Swift's letter to the Irish viceroy (Lord
Carteret), introducing Bishop Berkeley (then Dean of Derry),
and his project for resigning his preferment at home in
order that, on a stipend of £100 a year, he might devote himself
to the conversion of the American Indians? The imperturbable
patience with which the good Dean prosecuted his
object, the self-devotion with which he embarked in it his
property and life, the gratefulness with which he accepted
from the government the promise of a grant, and the treachery
which broke the promise, and after seven years compelled
his return, make up a story unrivalled for its contrast of
saintly simplicity and ministerial bad faith. These and similar
features of the time superfluously refute the arbitrary and
arrogant assumption, that no piety can be living and profound
except that which disbelieves all natural religion, no gospel
holy which does not renounce the moral law, no faith prolific
in works unless it begins with despising them.</p>

<p>There was, however, still a defect in this gospel of conscience.
Regarding the world and life as the object of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
divine administration, and seeking to interpret them by a
scheme of final causes, it was wholly occupied with the conception
of God as proposing to himself certain ends, and arranging
the means for their accomplishment. In this light
He is a Being with moral preconceptions and an economy
for bringing them to pass. Everything is for a purpose, and
subsists for the sake of what is ulterior, and forms part of a
mechanism working out a prescribed problem. The tendency
of this way of thinking will inevitably be, to hunt for providences.
These the narrow mind will place in the incidents
of individual life; the comprehensive intellect, in the laws and
relations of the universe; not perhaps in either case without
some danger from human egotism of referring too much to the
good and ill which is relative to man. The infinite perfections
of God will be concentrated, so to speak, too much in
the notion of His <span class="smcap">will</span>, and the powers which subserve its
designs; and will in consequence be as much misapprehended
as would be our own nature by an observer assuming that we
put forth all its life and phenomena <i>on purpose</i>. Indeed, the
exclusive and unbalanced ascendency of the moral faculty
tempts a man to fancy this sort of existence the only right one
for himself; to suspect every flow of unwatched feeling, and
call himself to account for the burst of ringing laughter, or the
surprise of sudden tears, and aim at an autocratic command of
his own soul. It is not wonderful that his ideal of human
character should reappear in his representation of the Divine.
The error deforms his faith as much as it tends to stiffen and
constrict his life. Leading him always to ask what a thing is
<i>for</i>, it hinders him from seeing what it <i>is</i>; in search of the
<i>motive</i>, he misses the <i>look</i>; and his interest in it being transitive,
he sinks into it with no sympathy on its own account.
This is only to say, in other words, that his prepossession detains
him from the <i>artistic</i> contemplation of objects and
events; for while it is the business of science to inquire their
<i>origination</i>, and of morals to follow their <i>drift</i>, it remains for
art to appreciate their <i>nature</i>. To feel the type of thought
which they express, to recognize the idea which they invest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with form, the mind must rest upon them, not as products or
as instruments, but as realities; and their significance must
not be imposed upon them, but read off from them. The
meaning which art detects in life and the world is not a purpose,
but a sentiment; in its view the present attitudes and
development of things are rather the out-coming of an inner
feeling than the tools of a remoter end. To find room for this
mode of conception something must be added to the ethical
representation of God. He must be regarded as not always
and throughout engaged in processes of intention and volition,
but as having, around this moral centre, an infinite atmosphere
of creative thought and affection, which, like the native
inspirations of a pure and sublime human soul, spontaneously
flow out in forms of beauty, and movements of rhythm, and a
thousand aspects of divine expression. Religion demands the
admission of this free element: and without it, will cease to
speak home to men of susceptible genius and poetic nature,
and must limit itself more and more to the fanatical minds
that have too little regulation, and the moral that have too
much. A God who offers terms of communion only to the
passionate and to the conscientious, will not touch the springs
of worship in perceptive and meditative men. <i>Their</i> prayer
is less to know the published rules than to overhear the lonely
whispers of the Eternal Mind, to be at one with His immediate
life in the universe, and to shape or sing into articulate
utterance the silent inspirations of which all existence is full.
Their peculiar faculties supply them with other interests than
about their sins, their salvation, and their conscience; they
feel neither sufficiently guilty, nor sufficiently anxious to be
good, to make a religion out of the one consciousness or the
other; but if, indeed, it be God that flashes on them in so
many lights of solemn beauty from the face of common things,
that wipes off sometimes the steams of custom from the window
of the soul, and surprises it with a presence of tenderness
and mystery,&mdash;if the tension of creative thought in themselves,
which can rest in nothing imperfect, yet realize nothing perfect,
be an unconscious aspiration towards Him,&mdash;then there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a way of access to their inner faith, and a temple pavement
on which they will consent to kneel. It is, we believe, the inability
of Protestantism, in either of its previous forms, to
meet this order of wants, that has reduced it to its state of
weakness and discredit; and the struggle of thought, characteristic
of the present century, is an unconscious attempt to
supply the defect, and to vindicate, for the third element of
Catholic Christianity, the possibility of development in the
open air of Protestant belief. The change began, like both
of the earlier ones, in Germany; and it was from Plato that
Schleiermacher learned where the weakness of Christian dogma
lay, and in what field of thought he might create a diversion
from the disastrous assaults of French materialism, and
restore the balance of the fight. An Hellenic spirit was infused
into the scientific theology of the Continent, and has
never ceased to prevail there, though Aristotle has long succeeded
to Plato as the channel of influence. When Hegel,
long the rival of Schleiermacher, triumphed over him, not only
in the coteries of Berlin, but in the schools of Germany, he no
doubt turned the philosophy which had been invoked to preserve
the faith into a dialectic, at whose magic touch it deliquesced;
and no one who has followed the application of his
principles to history and dogma can be surprised at the antipathy
they awaken in the Church. But it would be a mistake
to suppose that the step into Pantheism was made by Hegel,
and that the opposing theologians raised up by the great
preacher of Berlin occupy in this respect any different
ground. Since the time of Jacobi theism proper has not
been heard of in Germany: the very writers who <i>mean</i> to
defend it, surrender it in the disguise of their definition of personality;
and so steeped is the whole national mind in the
colors of Hellenic thought, that from Neander to Strauss can
be found, in our deliberate judgment, only different shades of
the same pantheistic conception. What does this denote but
a universal sigh after a God, who shall be neither a Jehovah,
a Judaic αυτοκρατωρ, nor a redeeming <i>Deus ex machinâ</i>, supervening
upon the theatre of history, but a living and energizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Spirit, quickening the very heart of to-day, and whispering
round the dome of Herschel's sky not less than in the third
story of Paul's heaven? In some this feeling breaks out in
devilish defiance, as in the unhappy Heinrich Heine's saying,
"I am no child, I do not want a Heavenly Father any more":
in others it breathes out, as with Novalis, in a tender mysticism,
and is traceable by the reverent footfall and uncovered
head with which they pace, as in a cathedral, the solemn aisles
of life and nature. The expression of this tendency has
passed into the literature of our own language, and every
year is tinging it more and more with its characteristic hues.
Emerson affords the purest and most unmixed example; but
perhaps the earlier writings of Carlyle,&mdash;before the divine
thirst had advanced so much into a human <i>rabies</i>,&mdash;and more
especially his <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, may be taken as the real gospel
of this sentiment. The intense operation of these essays,
so entirely alien to the traditions of English thought and taste,
is an evidence of something more than the genius of their authors:
it is proof of a certain combustible state of the English
mind, prepared by drought and deadness to burst into the
flame of this new worship. This feeling, diffused through the
very air of the time, has unmistakably evinced its essential
identity with the instinct of art; in part, by a direct affluence
and excellence of production unknown to the preceding age,
but still more, in the wide extension of an appreciating love
for the creations of artistic genius. The melancholy prophets
who see in this spreading susceptibility only a morbid symptom
of decadent civilization, are misled, we hope, by imperfect
historical parallels. The flower, no doubt, both of Athenian
and of Italian culture, was most brilliant just before it drooped.
But the soil which bore it, and the elements that surrounded
it, had no essential resemblance to the conditions of modern
English society, in which, above all, there are the unexhausted
juices of a moral faith and a strenuous habit, not stimulant
perhaps of hasty growth, but giving hardihood against
the open air and the natural seasons.</p>

<p>By the rules of technical theology, it may appear strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to reckon the turn from theism to pantheism as a <i>third stage
of the Reformation</i>; as if it could be at all included in the interior
history of Christianity, instead of being treated as a
direct apostasy. And it is in reality a very serious question,
whether, without unfaithfulness to its essential character, the
Christian religion can domesticate within it this new action of
thought, or must from the first visit it with unqualified excommunication.
On the one hand, nothing can be more absurd
than to suppose that a faith of Hebrew origin, a faith whose
very hypothesis is sin, and whose aspiration is moral perfectness,
can ever be reconciled with a thorough-going pantheism.
On the other hand, nothing can be more gratuitous than to
assume that the feeling which, on getting the whole mind to
itself, generates a pantheistic scheme, has <i>no</i> legitimate exercise,
and gains its indulgence altogether at the expense of
Christian truth. If we mistake not, the pith of the matter
lies in a small compass. <i>Let Christian Theism keep Morals,
and Pantheism may have Nature.</i> This rule is no mere compromise
or coalition of incongruous elements, but is founded,
we are convinced, on distinctions real and eternal. So long
as a holy will is left to God, and a power committed to man,
free to sustain relations of trust and responsibility, room remains
for all the conditions of Christianity, and the field beyond
may be open to the range of mystic perception, and
railed off for the sacrament of beauty. But whether this or
any other be the just partition of territory between the two
claimants, partition there must be, for the real truth of things
must correspond, not to the hypothesis of any single human
faculty, but to harmonized postulates of all. It is not surprising
that, on its first re-birth, the gospel of nature should deny
the gospel of duty, or so take it up into its own fine essence
as to volatilize all its substance away. This is but the natural
revenge taken for past neglect, and the needful challenge to
future attention. Each one of the three developments has in
its turn run out beyond the limits of the Christian faith, and
yet, hitherto, each has established a place within it. The Hegelian,
or Emersonian, type of the third period is but the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
phenomenon to the Antinomianism of the first, and
the Deism of the second. And as these have passed away,
after surrendering into the custody of Christendom the principles
that gave them strength, so will the Pantheism of to-day,
when it has provided for the safe-keeping of its charge, and
seen the Church complete its triad of Faith, Holiness, and
Beauty.</p>

<p>This question, however, will be asked: If the Reformation
only repeats, with some transposition, the cycle of the primitive
development, how are we the better for having thus to do
our work again? Are we to end where the sixteenth century
began, and to reproduce the Catholicism which was then resolved
into its elements? And does some fatal necessity doom
us to this wearisome periodicity? Not in the least. However
little the seeds may be able to transgress the limits of
species, and may remain indistinguishable from millennium to
millennium, the conditions of growth are so different as practically
to cancel the identity in the result. Taken even one by
one, the modern forms of doctrine are far nobler than their
early prototypes. The narrow Ebionitism of the original
Church is not comparable, as an expression of the conscience,
with the moral philosophy of Butler; and the Greek element
of thought, flowing by Berlin, has entered the Church in
deeper channels than when infiltrating through the theosophy
of Alexandria. It is only in relation to the passionate element
that the doubt can be raised, whether we have gained
in truth and grandeur by passing the religion of Augustine
through the minds of the modern reformers; and whether the
Jansenists within the Church do not exhibit a higher phase of
character than the Huguenots without it. But at any rate,
the modern development, taken as a whole, is secure of an inner
unity and completeness which before has been unattained.
It is an obvious, yet little noticed, consequence of the invention
of printing, that no one mood of feeling or school of
thought can tyrannize over a generation of mankind, and
sweep all before it, as of old; and then again, with change in
the intellectual season, rot utterly away, and give place to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
successor no less absolute. Generations and ages now live in
presence of each other; the impulse of the present is restrained
by the counsels of the past, and, in fighting for the
throne of the human mind, finds it not only strong in living
prepossession, but guarded by shadowy sentinels, encircled by
a band of immortals. Hence the history of ideas can never
be again so wayward and fitful as it was in the first centuries
of our era; losing all interest at one period in the questions
which had maddened the preceding; for a time covered all
over with the pale haze of Byzantine metaphysics, and then
suffused with red heats of African enthusiasm. New truth
can no longer forget the old, and thrive wholly at its expense,
or even make a compact with it to take turn and turn about,
but must find an organic relation with it, so as to be its enlargement
rather than its rival. The modern moralist already
understands Augustine better than did the old Pelagians;
"Evangelical" teachers begin to insist on Christian ethics;
and the increasing disposition, even in heterodox persons, to
dwell on the Incarnation as the central point of faith, shows
how credible and welcome becomes the notion of the union of
human with divine, and of the moral manifestation of God in
the life and soul of man. The time, we trust, is gone, for the
merely linear advancement of the European mind, with all its
action and reaction propagated downwards, and wasting centuries
on phenomena that might co-exist. Henceforth it may
open out in all dimensions at once, and fill, as its own for
ever, the whole space of true thought into which its past increments
have borne it. Sects, no doubt, and schools, will
continue to arise on the outskirts of the intellectual realm,
possessed by partial inspirations; but the world's centre of
gravity will be more and more occupied by minds that can at
once balance and retain these marginal excesses, that can
round off the sphere by inner force of reason, and, dispensing
with the outer mould of sacerdotal compression, let the tides
flow free, and the winds blow strong, without alarm for the
eternal harmony. This is the form in which nature will restore,
and God approve, a Catholic consent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea we have endeavored to give of the genesis of
Christian doctrine, and the law of its vicissitudes, is offered
only as conveniently distributing the subjective sources of
faith. It cannot be applied to the phenomena of particular
countries apart from ample historical knowledge of the concurrent
social and political conditions, without which the most
accurate clews to the natural history of <i>thought</i> can only mislead
as the interpreter of concrete <i>events</i>. When, for instance,
we look around us at home, and seek for the English representatives
of the several tendencies explained above, we may,
no doubt, find them here and there, but they are so far from
exhausting the facts of our time, that some of the most conspicuous
parties&mdash;as the Anglicans&mdash;seem provided with no
place at all. The obscurity first begins to clear away when
we remember that in England <i>Schism went before Reformation</i>.
The aim of Henry VIII. was simply to detach and
nationalize the Church in his dominions; to give it insular
integrity instead of provincial dependence; and could this
have been done without meddling with the system of Catholic
doctrine at all, the scheme of faith would have been preserved
entire. While Luther and the Continental opponents of Rome
were faithful to the idea of the unity of Christendom, and
were calling out for a general council to restore it by a
verdict on doubtful points of faith, the English monarch,
undisturbed by doubt or scruple, broke off from Rome, and
destroyed the traditions of centralization by taking the ecclesiastic
jurisdiction into his own hands and stopping its passage
of the seas. In the new movement of the time, England
tended to become a petty papacy, still unreformed; Europe
sought a universal church reformed. Neither aim admitted
of realization. To repudiate the supreme pontiff, and substitute
a civil head, involved a fatal breach in the sacerdotal
system, and carried with it inevitable departures from the
integrity of Catholic dogma; so that reformation was found
inseparable from schism. And when no council, acknowledged
as universal, was called to give authoritative settlement, arrangements
<i>ad interim</i> became consolidated, provisional rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
grew into prescriptive; with the spectacle of variety, and
the taste of freedom, the idea of unity faded away, till
the co-existence of two churches within one land and one
Christendom passed into a necessity, and reformation proved
impossible without a schism. But, notwithstanding this partial
approximation of the English and the Continental movements,
the traces remain indelible that their point of departure
was from opposite ends. In its origin and earliest traditions,
in the basis of its constitution and worship, the Church of
England has nothing whatever to do with Protestantism; it
is but the Westminster Catholic Church instead of the Roman
Catholic Church. Authoritative doctrine, sacramental grace,
sacerdotal mediation, are all retained; and throughout the
whole of Henry's reign, while the new laws were working
themselves into habits, the seven sacraments, the communion
in one kind, the Ave Maria, the invocation of saints, with the
doctrines of transubstantiation and purgatory, remained within
the circle of recognized orthodoxy. The impelling and regulative
idea of the whole change was that of a nationalization
of Catholicism. This original ascendency of the national over
the theological feeling was never lost; and though channels
were more and more opened, through the sympathies of exiles
and the intercourse of scholars, for the infusion of Continental
notions, yet the form given to the Church rendered it not
very susceptible to the new learning; whose admission, so far
as it took place, was rather induced by political conception
than made in the interests of universal truth. The present
Anglicans represent the first type of the English <i>schism</i>;
and the High Church in general embodies the distinguishing
<i>national</i> sentiment of the Reformation in this country, as compared
with the <i>cosmopolitan</i> character of the Continental religious
change. Doctrine is universal, administration and
jurisdiction are local. Where the former becomes the bond
of sympathy, as among the Evangelic Protestants, it unites
men together by ties that are irrespective of the limits of
country, and subordinates special patriotisms to the interests
of a more comprehensive fraternity. Where the latter become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the objects of zeal, a flavor of the soil mingles itself
with the sentiments of honor, and a peculiar loyalty concentrates
itself on the inner circles of duty, often with the narrowest
capacity of diffusion beyond. Hence the intensely
<i>English</i> feeling which has always prevailed among the parochial&mdash;especially
the rural&mdash;clergy of the Establishment, and
the people who form their congregations. They constitute
the very core of our insular society, and the retaining centre
of our historical characteristics. Their admirations, their
prejudices, their virtues, their ambitions, are all national.
Their interest in dogma is not intellectually active, or provocative
of any proselyting zeal, and is subservient to the
practical aim of giving territorial action to the religious institutions
under their charge. Their dealings are less with
the individual's solitary soul, than with the several social
classes in their mutual relations; and to mediate between
the gentry and the poor, to keep in order the school, the
workhouse, and the village charities,&mdash;not forgetting the
obligation to ward off Methodists and voluntaries,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;constitute
the approved circle of clerical duties. Their very antipathies,
unlike those of Protestant zealots, are less theological
than political; they hate Roman Catholics chiefly as
a sort of <i>foreigners</i>, who have no proper business here, and
Dissenters as a sort of <i>rebels</i>, who create disturbance with
their discontents; and were old England well rid of them
both, the heart of her citizenship, they believe, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
sounder. They stand, indeed, in a curious position, pledged
to hold a proud Anglican isolation between two cosmopolitan
interests,&mdash;the Popish theocracy and the Evangelical dogma,&mdash;refusing
obedience to Rome, yet declining the alliance of
foreign Protestants. Their enmity to the Papal system is
quite a different sentiment from that which animates Exeter
Hall; they do not deny the absolute legitimacy of the elder
corporation in general, but only its relative legitimacy <i>here</i>;
and Scottish ravings against it as "Babylon" and "Antichrist"
offend them more than the confessional and the mass.
Twice in their history&mdash;under the Stuarts and in our own
day&mdash;have they seemed to forget their destiny, and make
overtures to the Vatican; in both instances it was when Puritanism
had threatened to take possession of the Church, and
reduce it to a federal member of an Evangelical alliance;
and if its separate integrity were in peril, they had rather
fling it back into the Apostolic monarchy, than enroll it in the
Genevan league. But the first real sight of danger from
the Papal side has dissipated this reactionary inclination, and
rekindled the instinct of local independence. Thus, in our
Church, ideal interests and purely religious conceptions have
held the second place to a predominating nationalism. The
Church has embodied and handed down the leading sentiment
of the Tudor times; and though not guiltless of share in many
a Stuart treachery, and often cruel to the stiff-necked recusant,
has, on the whole, been true to the English feeling, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the Pope was too great a priest, and Calvin too long a
preacher.</p>

<p>The reason then is evident why the Church of England
cannot be referred to any of the heads of classification we
have given; neither coinciding with Romanism, nor exemplifying
distinctively any of the tendencies springing successively
out of the disintegration of Catholic dogma. It arose
out of an ecclesiastical revolt; other communions, out of a
theological aspiration. Its original conception involved no
serious modification of belief, no invention or recovery of
strange usages, but a mere separation of the island branch
from the Roman stem, that it might strike root and be as a
native tree of life. The first alterations in doctrine were
slight, and merely incidental to this primary end: and the
whole amount of change, instead of being determined by the
intellectual dictatorship of a Luther or a Calvin, was the illogical
result of social forces, seeking the equilibrium of practical
compromise. The phenomenon therefore which we observed
in the elder Church is repeated in this younger offshoot:
the several elements of faith co-exist (though in greatly spoiled
proportions) without unity or natural coherence; and the
English Church, as the depository of a creed, occupies no
place in the history of the human mind: its individual great
men must be put here or there in the records of thought, without
regard to the accident of their ecclesiastical position. The
one real idea which has permanently inspired its clergy and
supporters is that of <i>nationalism in religion</i>. To the time of
the Restoration they <i>attempted</i>, since then they have <i>pretended</i>,
to represent the nation in its faith and worship. Once, their
aim appeared to be a noble possibility, struggling still and unrealized,
but unrefuted. Now, thousands of Non-conformist
chapels proclaim its meaning gone, and its language an affectation
and an insolence. The English Church has become an
outer reality without an inner idea.</p>

<p>In contrast with the <i>insular</i> feeling predominant in the
English schism, we have placed the <i>cosmopolitan</i> zeal of the
foreign Puritanism. With this, however, was combined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
very opposite pole of sentiment,&mdash;a certain <i>egoism</i> and loneliness
in religion, from which have flowed some of the most important
characteristics of Protestantism. Having flung away,
as miserable quackeries, the hierarchical prescriptions for souls
oppressed with sin, Luther fell back upon an act of subjective
faith in place of the Church's objective works. For the corporation
he substituted the individual: whom he put in immediate,
instead of mediate, relation with Christ and God.
The Catholic's unbloody sacrifice had no efficacy, no existence,
without the priest; the Lutheran's bloody sacrifice was a
realized historical fact, to be appropriated separately by every
believer's personal trust. It was not, therefore, the Church
which, in its corporate capacity, occupied the prior place, and
held the deposit of divine grace for distribution to its members;
but it was the private person that constituted the sacred
unit, and a plurality of believers supplied the factors of the
Church. The grace which before could not reach the individual
except by transit through accredited officials, now became
directly accessible to each soul: and only after it had
been received by a sufficient number to form a society, did
the conditions of spiritual office and organization exist. This
essential dependence of the whole upon the parts, instead of
the parts upon the whole, is the most radical and powerful
peculiarity of Protestantism. A system which raises the individual
to the primary place of religious importance, places
him nearest to the supernatural energy of God, and makes him
the living stone without which temple and altar cannot be
built, naturally draws to it minds of marked vigor, and trains
men in self-subsisting habits. By giving scope to the forces
of private character, it sets in action the real springs of healthy
progress, and happily with such intensity as to defy the checks
it often seeks to impose in later moods of repentant alarm.
This emancipation of the personal life from theocratic control,
at first achieved in connection with the doctrine of justification,
was sure to present itself in other forms. In its <i>spiritual</i> application
Protestant egoism assumes the shape of reliance on
<i>inner faith</i>; in its <i>political</i>, of <i>voluntaryism</i>; in its <i>intellectual</i>,
of free inquiry and <i>private judgment</i>. These several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
directions may be taken separately or together, but where, as
in the Church of England, <i>not one</i> of them is unambiguously
marked, the very principle of reformed Christianity is unsecured,
and Protestantism is present, not by charter, but by
social accident. Puritanism everywhere&mdash;conforming or nonconforming,
English or Continental&mdash;exhibits the first direction;
"Evangelical" Dissenters add the second; while Unitarians
occupy the third,&mdash;not perhaps completely, and not
altogether exclusively, but characteristically nevertheless. For
it is impossible to unite the orthodox with the intellectual
egoism. So long as the <i>inner faith</i>, which is the presumed
condition of justification, includes a controverted doctrine, like
the scheme of Atonement, the need of faith imposes a limit
on the right of judgment: and you are only free to think till
you show symptoms of thinking wrong. But when the sacrificial
Christianity has passed into the ethical, and no other
condition of harmony with God is laid down than purity of
affection and fidelity of will, then honest thought can peril no
salvation, and the devotion of the intellect to truth and the
heart to grace is a divided allegiance no more.</p>

<p>It was for some time doubtful how far this Protestant egoism
was likely to go. Luther was clear and positive that it was
faith that justified; and fetching this doctrine out of a deep
personal experience, he paid little respect to any one who
contradicted it, and regulated by it his first choice of religious
authorities. Led by this clew, he arrived at results strangely
at variance with modern canons. He neither accepted as a
standard the whole Bible, nor at first rejected the whole tradition
of the Church; loosely attempting to reserve the Augustinian
authorities, and to repudiate the Dominican. When
he had renounced altogether the appeal to councils and patristic
lore, it was in favor, not of the external Scriptures, unconditionally
taken as the rule of faith, but of the private spirit
of the Christian reader, who was himself "made king and
priest," and could not only find the meaning, but pronounce
upon the relative worth, of the canonical books. Accordingly,
the Reformer made very free with portions of the Old Testament,
and with the more Judaic elements of the New,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Epistle to the Hebrews, that of James, and the Apocalypse;
and avowedly did this because he disliked the flavor of their
doctrine, and felt its variance from the Pauline gospel. He
thus tampered with his court before he brought forward his
cause, and incapacitated the judges whose verdict he feared.
In short, the religious life of his own soul was too intense and
powerful to be prevailed over by any written word: he appropriated
what was congenial, and threw away the rest.
Uneasy relations were thus established between the subjective
rule of faith found in the believer's own mind, and the objective
standard of a documentary revelation: they were soon
constituted, and have ever since remained rival authorities,
commanding the allegiance of different orders of minds. The
vast majority of Protestants, of less profound and tumultuous
inner life than Luther, and less knowing how to see their way
through it, subsided into exclusive recognition of the sacred
writings; denying alike the regulative authority either of
church councils or of the private soul. In every branch and
derivative of the Genevan Reformation, throughout the whole
range of both the Puritan and the Arminian Churches, a rigorous
Scripturalism prevails; and the Bible is used as a code
or legislative text-book, which yields, on mere interpretation,
verdicts without appeal on every subject, whether doctrine or
duty, of which it speaks. But Luther's spiritual enthusiasm
kindled a fire that he scarce could quench; and while he himself,
flung into perpetual conflicts with opponents, was obliged
more and more to refer to evidence external to his personality,
others had learned from him to look upon their own souls
as the theatre of conscious strife between heaven and hell, and
to recognize the voice of inspiration there. Carlstadt was the
first to catch the flame of his teacher's burning experience,
and, touched by prophetic consciousness, to set the Spirit above
the Word. Luther, so often recalled from the tendencies of
his own turbulent teaching by seeing their mischiefs realized in
other men, instantly turned on Carlstadt with his overwhelming
scorn: "The spirit of our new prophet flies very high
indeed: 't is an audacious spirit, that would eat up the Holy
Ghost, feathers and all. 'The Bible?'&mdash;sneer these fellows,&mdash;'Bibel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Bubel, Babel!' And not only do they reject the
Bible thus contemptuously, but they say they would reject God
too, if he were not to visit them as he did his prophets." Carlstadt
had got hold of a doctrine that was too much for his ill-balanced
mind, and Luther easily destroyed his repute. But
a principle had been started which has never been dormant
since; the very principle which afterwards constituted the
Society of Friends, and finds its best exposition in the writings
of their admirable apologist, Barclay; and which in our times
reappears in more philosophic guise, and fights its old battles
again as the doctrine of religious intuition. No period of
awakened faith and sentiment has been without some increasing
tincture of this persuasion; and under modified forms,
with more or less admixture of the ordinary Puritan elements,
it has played a great part among the Quietists in France, the
Moravians in Germany, and the Methodists in England. In
all these, far as they are from being committed to the notion
of an "inner light," spiritualism has predominated over Scripturalism,
and permanent life in the Spirit has engaged the
affections more than the transition into the adoption of faith.</p>

<p>In this endeavor to lay out the ground-plan of modern
Christian development, and trace upon it the chief lines both of
psychological and of historical distinction, our design is to prepare
the way for a series of sketches exhibiting the sects and
types of religion in England. It is scarcely possible to notice
the phenomena present here and to-day without referring to
their antecedents in a prior age, their counterparts in other
lands, and their permanent principles in human nature; and
if our chart be tolerably correct, our future course will be
rendered less indeterminate by the relations and points of
comparison which have been established. The age, and even
the hour, is teeming with new interests and pregnant auguries
in relation to the highest element of human well-being. From
a desire to approach these in a temper of just and reverential
appreciation, we have abstained from recording the first impression
of them, and sought rather, by a preliminary discipline,
to detect some criteria by which prejudices may be
checked, tendencies be estimated, and criticism acquire a clew.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHRISTIANITY_WITHOUT_PRIEST_AND" id="CHRISTIANITY_WITHOUT_PRIEST_AND">CHRISTIANITY WITHOUT PRIEST AND
WITHOUT RITUAL.</a></h2>

<blockquote class="matchind"><p>"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
but chosen of God, and precious; ye also, as lively stones, are built
up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."&mdash;1 Peter ii. 4, 5.</p></blockquote>


<p>The formation of human society, and the institution of
priesthood, must be referred to the same causes and the same
date. The earliest communities of the world appear to have
had their origin and their cement, not in any gregarious instinct,
nor in mere social affections, much less in any prudential
regard to the advantages of co-operation, but in a binding
religious sentiment, submitting to the same guidance, and
expressing itself in the same worship. As no tie can be
more strong, so is none more primitive, than this agreement
respecting what is holy and divine. In simple and patriarchal
ages, indeed, when the feelings of veneration had not
been set aside by analysis into a little corner of the character,
but spread themselves over the whole of life, and mixed
it up with daily wonder, this bond comprised all the forces
that can suppress the selfish and disorganizing passions, and
compact a multitude of men together. It was not, as at
present, to have simply the same <i>opinions</i> (things of quite
modern growth, the brood of scepticism); but to have the
same fathers, the same tradition, the same speech, the same
land, the same foes, the same priest, the same God. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
did man fear, or trust, or love, or desire, that did not belong,
by some affinity, to his faith. Nor had he any book to keep
the precious deposit for him; and if he had, he would never
have thought of so frail a vehicle for so great a treasure. It
was more natural to put it into structures hollowed in the
fast mountain, or built of transplanted rocks which only a
giant age could stir; and to tenant these with mighty hierarchies,
who should guard their sanctity, and, by an undying
memory, make their mysteries eternal. Hence, the
first humanizer of men was their worship; the first leaders
of nations, the sacerdotal caste; the first triumph of art, the
colossal temple; the first effort to preserve an idea produced
a record of something sacred; and the first civilization was,
as the last will be, the birth of religion.</p>

<p>The primitive aim of worship undoubtedly was, to act upon
the sentiments of God; at first, by such natural and intelligible
means as produce favorable impressions on the mind
of a fellow-man,&mdash;by presents and persuasion, and whatever
is expressive of grateful and reverential affections. Abel, the
first shepherd, offered the produce of his flock; Cain, the
first farmer, the fruits of his land; and while devotion was
so simple in its modes, every one would be his own pontiff,
and have his own altar. But soon, the parent would inevitably
officiate for his family; the patriarch, for his tribe.
With the natural forms dictated by present feelings, traditional
methods would mingle their contributions from the
past; postures and times, gestures and localities, once indifferent,
would become consecrated by venerable habit; and
so long as their origin was unforgotten, they would add to
the significance, while they lessened the simplicity, of worship.
Custom, however, being the growth of time, tends to
a tyrannous and bewildering complexity: forms, originally
natural, then symbolical, end in being arbitrary; suggestive
of nothing, except to the initiated; yet, if connected with
religion, so sanctified by the association, that it appears sacrilege
to desist from their employment; and when their meaning
is lost, they assume their place, not among empty gesticulations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
but among the mystical signs by which earth communes
with heaven. The vivid picture-writing of the early
worship, filled with living attitudes, and sketched in the
freshest colors of emotion, explained itself to every eye, and
was open to every hand. To this succeeded a piety, which
expressed itself in symbolical figures, veiling it utterly from
strangers, but intelligible and impressive still to the soul of
national tradition. This, however, passed again into a language
of arbitrary characters, in which the herd of men saw
sacredness without meaning; and the use of which must be
consigned to a class separated for its study. Hence the origin
of the priest and his profession; the conservator of a worship
no longer natural, but legendary and mystical; skilful enactor
of rites that spake with silent gesticulation to the heavens;
interpreter of the wants of men into the divine language of
the gods. Not till the powers above had ceased to hold
familiar converse with the earth, and in their distance had become
deaf and dumb to the common tongue of men, did the
mediating priest arise;&mdash;needed then to conduct the finger-speech
of ceremony, whereby the desire of the creature took
shape before the eye of the Creator.</p>

<p>Observe, then, the true idea of <span class="smcap">Priest</span> and <span class="smcap">Ritual</span>. The
Priest is the representative of men before God; commissioned
on behalf of human nature to intercede with the divine. He
bears a message <i>upwards</i>, from earth to heaven; his people
being below, his influence above. He takes the fears of the
weak, and the cries of the perishing, and sets them with availing
supplication before Him that is able to help. He takes
the sins and remorse of the guilty, and leaves them with expiating
tribute at the feet of the averted Deity. He guards
the avenues that lead from the mortal to the immortal, and
without his interposition the creature is cut off from his
Creator. Without his mediation no transaction between them
can take place, and the spirit of a man must live as an outlaw
from the world invisible and holy. There are means of
propitiation which he alone has authority to employ; powers
of persuasion conceded to no other; a mystic access to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
springs of divine benignity, by outward rites which his manipulation
must consecrate, or forms of speech which his lips
must recommend. These ceremonies are the implements of
his office and the sources of his power; the magic by which
he is thought to gain admission to the will above, and really
wins rule over human counsels below. As they are supposed
to change the relation of God to man, not by visible or natural
operation, not (for example) by suggestion of new thoughts,
and excitement of new dispositions in the worshipper, but by
secret and mysterious agency, they are simply <i>spells</i> of a dignified
order. Were we then to speak with severe exactitude,
we should say, a Ritual is a system of consecrated charms;
and the Priest, the great magician who dispenses them.</p>

<p>So long as any idea is retained of mystically efficacious
rites, consigned solely and authoritatively to certain hands,
this definition cannot be escaped. The ceremonies may have
rational instruction and natural worship appended to them;
and these additional elements may give them a title to true
respect. The order of men appointed to administer them
may have other offices and nobler duties to perform, rendering
them, if faithful, worthy of a just and reverential attachment.
But <i>in so far</i> as, by an exclusive and unnatural
efficacy, they bring about a changed relation between God
and man, the Ritual is an incantation, and the Priest is an
enchanter.</p>

<p>To this sacerdotal devotion there necessarily attach certain
characteristic sentiments, both moral and religious, which
give it a distinctive influence on human character, and adapt
it to particular stages of civilization. It clearly severs the
worshippers by one remove from God. He is a Being, external
to them, distant from them, personally unapproachable
by them; their thought must <i>travel</i> to reach the Almighty;
they must look afar for the Most Holy; they dwell themselves
within the finite, and must ask a foreign introduction to the
Infinite. He is not with them as a private guide, but in the
remoter watch-towers of creation, as the public inspector of
their life; not present for perpetual communion, but to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
visited in absence by stated messages of form and prayer.
And that God dwells in this cold and royal separation induces
the feeling, that man is too mean to touch him; that a
consecrated intervention is required, in order to part Deity
from the defiling contact of humanity. Why else am I restricted
from unlimited personal access to my Creator, and
driven to another in my transactions with him? And so, in
this system, our nature appears in contrast, not in alliance,
with the divine, and those views of it are favored which
make the opposition strong; its puny dimensions, its swift
decadence, its poor self-flatteries, its degenerate virtues, its
giant guilt, become familiar to the thought and lips; and life,
cut off from sympathy with the godlike, falls towards the
level of melancholy, or the sink of epicurism, or the abjectness
of vicarious reliance on the priest. Worship, too, must
have for its chief aim, to throw off the load of ill; to rid the
mind of sin and shame, and the lot of hardship and sorrow;
for principally to these disburdening offices do priests and
rituals profess themselves adapted;&mdash;and who, indeed, could
pour forth the privacy of love, and peace, and trust, through
the cumbrousness of ceremonies, and the pompousness of a
sacred officer? The piety of such a religion is thus a refuge
for the weakness, not an outpouring of the strength, of the
soul: it takes away the incubus of darkness, without shedding
the light of heaven; lifts off the nightmare horrors of
earth and hell, without opening the vision of angels and of
God. Nay, for the spiritual bonds which connect men with
the Father above, it substitutes material ties, a genealogy of
sacred fires, a succession of hallowed buildings, or of priests
having consecration by pedigree or by manual transmission;
so that qualities belonging to the soul alone are likened to
forces mechanical or chemical; sanctity becomes a physical
property; divine acceptance comes by bodily catenation; regeneration
is degraded into a species of electric shock, which
one only method of experiment, and the links of but one
conductor, can convey. And, in fine, a priestly system ever
abjures all aim at any higher perfection; boasts of being immutable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and unimprovable; encourages no ambition, breathes
no desire. It holds the appointed methods of influencing
Heaven, on which none may presume to innovate; and its
functions are ever the same, to employ and preserve the
ancient forms and legendary spells committed to its trust.
Hence all its veneration is antiquarian, not sympathetic or
prospective; it turns its back upon the living, and looks
straight into departed ages, bowing the head and bending the
knee; as if all objects of love and devotion were <i>there</i>,
not here; in history, not in life; as if its God were dead, or
otherwise imprisoned in the Past, and had bequeathed to its
keeping such relics as might yield a perpetual benediction.
Thus does the administration of religion, in proportion as it
possesses a sacerdotal character, involve a distant Deity, a
mean humanity, a servile worship, a physical sanctity, and a
retrospective reverence.</p>

<p>Let no one, however, imagine that there is no other idea
or administration of religion than this; that the priest is the
only person among men to whom it is given to stand between
heaven and earth. Even the Hebrew Scriptures introduce
us to another class of quite different order; to whom, indeed,
those Scriptures owe their own truth and power, and perpetuity
of beauty: I mean the <span class="smcap">Prophets</span>; whom we shall very
imperfectly understand, if we suppose them mere historians,
for whom God had turned time round the other way, so that
they spoke of things future as if past, and grew so dizzy in
their use of tenses, as greatly to incommode learned grammarians;
or if we treat their writings as scrap-books of Providence,
with miscellaneous contributions from various parts
of duration, sketches taken indifferently from any point of
view within eternity, and put together at random and without
mark, on adjacent pages, for theological memories to identify;
first, a picture of an Assyrian battle, next, a holy family; now,
of the captives sitting by Euphrates, then, of Paul preaching
to the Gentiles; here, a flight of devouring locusts, and there,
the escape of the Christians from the destruction of Jerusalem;
a portrait of Hezekiah, and a view of Calvary; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
march through the desert, and John the Baptist by the Jordan;
the day of Pentecost, and the French Revolution;
Nebuchadnezzar and Mahomet; Caligula and the Pope,&mdash;following
each other with picturesque neglect of every relation
of time and place. No, the Prophet and his work always
indeed belong to the future; but far otherwise than thus.
Meanwhile, let us notice how, in Israel, as elsewhere, he
takes his natural station above the priest. It was Moses the
prophet who even <i>made</i> Aaron the priest. And who cares
now for the sacerdotal books of the Old Testament, compared
with the rest? Who, having the strains of David, would pore
over Leviticus, or would weary himself with Chronicles, when
he might catch the inspiration of Isaiah? It was no priest
that wrote, "Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it;
thou delightest not in burnt-offering: the sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God,
thou wilt not despise." It was no pontifical spirit that exclaimed,
"Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination
to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn
meeting: your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul
hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear
them." "Wash you, make you clean." Whatever in these
venerable Scriptures awes us by its grandeur and pierces us
by its truth, comes of the prophets, not the priests; and from
that part of their writings, too, in which they are not concerned
with historical prediction, but with some utterance
deeper and greater. I do not deny them this gift of occasional
intellectual foresight of events. And doubtless it was
an honor to be permitted to speak thus to a portion of the
future, and of local occurrences unrevealed to seers less privileged.
But it is a glory far higher to speak that which belongs
to all time, and finds its interpretation in every place; to
penetrate to the everlasting realities of things; to disclose,
not when this or that man will appear, but how and wherefore
all men appear and quickly disappear; to make it felt, not in
what nook of duration such an incident will happen, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
what all-embracing eternity the images of history emerge and
are swallowed up. In this highest faculty the Hebrew seers
belong to a class scattered over every nation and every
period; which Providence keeps ever extant for human good,
and especially to furnish an administration of religion quite
anti-sacerdotal. This class we must proceed to characterize.</p>

<p>The Prophet is the representative of God before men, commissioned
from the Divine nature to sanctify the human.
He bears a message <i>downwards</i>, from heaven to earth; his
inspirer being above, his influence below. He takes of the
holiness of God, enters with it into the souls of men, and heals
therewith the wounds, and purifies the taint, of sin. He is
charged with the peace of God, and gives from it rest to the
weariness and solace to the griefs of men. Instead of carrying
the foulness of life to be cleansed in heaven, he brings
the purity of heaven to make life divine. Instead of interposing
himself and his mediation between humanity and Deity,
he destroys the whole distance between them; and only fulfils
his mission, when he brings the finite mind and the infinite
into immediate and thrilling contact, and leaves the creature
consciously alone with the Creator. He is one to whom the
primitive and everlasting relations between God and man
have revealed themselves, stripped of every disguise, and
bared of all that is conventional; who is possessed by their
simplicity, mastered by their solemnity; who has found the
secret of meeting the Holy Spirit within, rather than without;
and knows, but cannot tell, how, in the strife of genuine duty,
or in moments of true meditation, the Divine immensity and
love have touched and filled his naked soul; and taught him
by what fathomless Godhead he is folded round, and on what
adamantine manhood he must take his stand. So far from
separating others from the heavenly communion vouchsafed
to himself, he necessarily believes that all may have the same
godlike consciousness; burns to impart it to them; and by the
vivid light of his own faith speedily creates it in those who
feel his influence, drawing out and freshening the faded colors
of the Divine image in their souls, till they too become visibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the seers and the sons of God. His instruments, like the
objects of his mission, are human; not mysteries, and mummeries,
and such arbitrary things, by which others may pretend
to be talking with the skies; but the natural language
which interprets itself at once to every genuine man, and
goes direct to the living point of every heart. An earnest
speech, a brave and holy life, truth of sympathy, severity of
conscience, freshness and loftiness of faith,&mdash;these natural
sanctities are his implements of power; and if heaven be
pleased to add any other gifts, still are they weapons all,&mdash;not
the mere tinsel of tradition and custom,&mdash;but forged in
the inner workshop of our nature, where the fire glows beneath
the breath of God, framing things of ethereal temper.
Thus armed, he lays undoubting siege to the world's conscience;
tears down every outwork of pretence; forces its
strong-holds of delusion; humbles the vanities at its centre,
and proclaims it the citadel of God. The true prophet of
every age is no believer in the temple, but in the temple's
Deity; trusts, not rites and institutions, but the heart and soul
that fill or ought to fill them; if they speak the truth, no one
so reveres them; if a lie, they meet with no contempt like
his. He sees no indestructible sanctuary but the mind itself,
wherein the Divine Spirit ever loves to dwell; and whence it
will be sure to go forth and build such outward temple as may
suit the season of Providence. He is conscious that there is
no devotion like that which comes spontaneously from the
secret places of our humanity, no orisons so true as those
which rise from the common platform of our life. He desires
only to throw himself in faith on the natural piety of
the heart. Give him but that, and he will find for man
an everlasting worship, and raise for God a cathedral worthy
of his infinitude.</p>

<p>It is evident that one thoroughly possessed with this spirit
could never be, and could never make, a priest; nor frame a
ritual for priests already made. He is destitute of the ideas
out of which alone these things can be created. His mission
is in the opposite direction: he interprets and reveals God to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
men, instead of interceding for men with God. In this office
sacerdotal rites have no function and no place. I do not say
that he must necessarily disapprove and abjure them, or deny
that he may directly sanction them. If he does, however, it
is not in his capacity of prophet, but in conformity with feelings
which his proper office has left untouched. His tendency
will be against ceremonialism; and on his age and position
will depend the extent to which this tendency takes effect.
Usually he will construct nothing ritual, will destroy much,
and leave behind great and growing ideas, destructive of much
more. But ere we quit our general conception of a prophet,
let us notice some characteristic sentiments, moral and religious,
which naturally connect themselves with his faith;
comparing them with those which belong to the sacerdotal
influence.</p>

<p>In this faith, God is separated by nothing from his worshippers.
He is not simply in contact with them, but truly
in the interior of their nature; so that they may not only
meet him in the outward providences of life, but bear his
spirit with them, when they go to toil and conflict, and find it
still, when they sit alone to think and pray. He is not the
far observer, but the very present help, of the faithful will.
No structure made with hands, nay, not even his own architecture
of the heaven of heavens, contains and confines
his presence: were there any dark recess whence these were
hid, the blessed access would be without hinderance still;
and the soul would discern him near as its own identity. No
mean and ignoble conception can be entertained of a mind
which is thus the residence of Deity;&mdash;the shrine of the
Infinite must have somewhat that is infinite itself. Thus, in
this system, does our nature appear in alliance with the Divine,
not in contrast with it; inspired with a portion of its
holiness, and free to help forward the best issues of its providence.
Human life, blessed by this spirit, becomes a miniature
of the work of the great Ruler: its responsibilities, its
difficulties, its temptations, become dignified as the glorious
theatre whereon we strive, by and with the good Spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
God, for the mastery over evil. Worship, issuing from a
nature and existence thus consecrated, is not the casting off
of guilt and terror, but the glad unburdening of love, and
trust, and aspiration, the simple speaking forth, as duty is
the acting forth, of the divine within us; not the prostration
of the slave, but the embrace of the child; not the plaint of
the abject, but the anthem of the free. Is it not private,
individual? And may it not by silence say what it will, and
intimate the precise thing, and that only, which is at heart?&mdash;whence
there grows insensibly that firm root of excellence,
truth with one's own self. The priestly fancy of an hereditary
or lineal sacredness can have no place here. The soul and
God stand directly related, mind with mind, spirit with spirit:
from our moral fidelity to this relation, from the jealousy with
which we guard it from insult or neglect, does the only sanctity
arise; and herein there is none to help us, or give a
vicarious consecration. And, finally, the spirit of God's true
prophet is earnestly prospective; more filled with the conception
of what the Creator <i>will</i> make his world, than of
what he <i>has</i> already made it: detecting great capacities, it
glows with great hopes; knowing that God lives, and will
live, it turns from the past, venerable as that may be, and
reverences rather the promise of the present, and the glories
of the future. It esteems nothing unimprovable, is replete
with vast desires; and amid the shadows and across the wilds
of existence chases, not vainly, a bright image of perfection.
The golden age, which priests with their tradition put into
the past, the prophet, with his faith and truth, transfers into
the future; and while the former pines and muses, the latter
toils and prays. Thus does the administration of religion,
in proportion as it partakes of the prophetic or anti-sacerdotal
character, involve the ideas of an interior Deity, a noble
humanity, a loving worship, an individual holiness, and a
prospective veneration.</p>

<p>We have found, then, two opposite views of religion: that
of the Priest with his Ritual, and that of the Prophet with
his Faith. I propose to show that the Church of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
in its doctrine of sacraments, coincides with the former of
these, and sanctions all its objectionable sentiments; and
that Christianity, in every relation, even with respect to its
reputed rites, coincides with the latter.</p>

<p>The general conformity of the Church of England with the
ritual conception of religion will not be denied by her own
members. Their denial will be limited to one point: they
will protest that her formulas of doctrine do not ascribe a
<i>charmed efficacy</i>, or any operation upon God, to the two
sacraments. To avoid verbal disputes, let us consider what
we are to understand by a spell or charm. The name, I apprehend,
denotes any material object or outward act, the possession
or use of which is thought to confer safety or blessing,
not by natural operation, but by occult virtues inherent in
it, or mystical effects appended to it. A mere commemorative
sign, therefore, is not a charm, nor need there be any
superstition in its employment: it simply stands for certain
ideas and memories in our minds; re-excites and freshens
them, not otherwise than speech audibly records them, except
that it summons them before us by sight and touch, instead of
sound. The effect, whatever it may be, is purely natural, by
sequence of thought on thought, till the complexion of the
mind is changed, and haply suffused with a noble glow. But
in truth it is not fit to speak of commemorations, as things
having efficacy at all; as desirable observances, under whose
action we should put ourselves, in order to get up certain
good dispositions in the heart. As soon as we see them acquiesced
in, with this dutiful submission to a kind of spiritual
operation, we may be sure they are already empty and dead.
An <i>expedient</i> commemoration, deliberately maintained on utilitarian
principles, for the sake of warming cold affections by
artificial heat, is one of the foolish conceptions of this mechanical
and sceptical age. It is quite true, that such influence is
found to belong to rites of remembrance; but only so long as
it is not privately looked into, or greedily contemplated by
the staring eye of prudence, but simply and unconsciously
received. No; commemorations must be the spontaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
fruit and outburst of a love already kindled in the soul, not
the factitious contrivance for forcing it into existence. They
are not the lighted match applied to the fuel on an altar cold;
but the shapes in which the living flame aspires, or the fretted
lights thrown by that central love on the dark temple-walls of
this material life.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that the sacraments are mere commemorative
rites. And nothing, I submit, remains, but that
they should be pronounced charms. It is of little purpose
to urge, in denial of this, that the Church insists upon the
necessity of faith on the part of the recipient, without which
no benefit, but rather peril, will accrue. This only limits the
use of the charm to a certain class, and establishes a prerequisite
to its proper efficacy. It simply conjoins the outward
form with a certain state of mind, and gives to each of
these a participation in the effect. If the faith be insufficient
without the ceremony, then <i>some</i> efficacy is due to the rite;
and this, being neither the natural operation of the material
elements, nor a simple suggestion of ideas and feelings to the
mind, but mystical and preternatural, is no other than a
charmed efficacy.</p>

<p>Nor will the statement, that the effect is not upon God, but
upon man, bear examination. It is very true, that the <i>ultimate</i>
benefit of these rites is a result reputed to fall upon the
worshipper;&mdash;regeneration, in the case of baptism; participation
in the atonement, in the case of the Lord's Supper.
But by what steps do these blessings descend? Not by those
of visible or perceived causation; but through an express and
extraordinary volition of God, induced by the ceremonial
form, or taking occasion from it. The sacerdotal economy,
therefore, is so arranged, that, whenever the priest dispenses
the water at the font, the Holy Spirit follows, as in instantaneous
compliance with a suggestion; and whenever he
spreads his hands over the elements at the communion, God
immediately establishes a preternatural relation, not subsisting
the moment before, between the substances on the table and
the souls of the faithful communicants: so that every partaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
receives, either directly or through supernatural increase of
faith, some new share in the merits of the cross. Whatever
subtleties of language then may be employed, it is evidently
conceived that the first consequence of these forms takes place
in heaven; and that on this depends whatever benediction
they may bring: nor can a plain understanding frame any
other idea of them than this; first, they act upwards, and
suggest something to the mind of God, who then sends down
an influence on the mind of the believer. From this conception
no figures of speech, no ingenious analogies, can deliver
us. Do you call the sacraments "pledges of grace"? A
pledge means a promise; and how a voluntary act of ours, or
the priest's, can be a promise made to us by the Divine Being,
it is not easy to understand. Do you call them "seals of
God's covenant,"&mdash;the instrument by which he engages to
make over its blessings to the Christian, like the signature and
completion of a deed conveying an estate? It still perplexes
us to think of a service of our own as an assurance received
by us from Heaven. And one would imagine that the Divine
promise, once given, were enough, without this incessant binding
by periodical legalities. If it be said, "The renewal of
the obligation is needful for us, and not for him"; then call
the rites at once and simply, our service of self-dedication, the
solemn memorial of our vows. And in spite of all metaphors,
the question recurs, Does the covenant stand without these
seals, or are they essential <i>to give possession</i> of the privileges
conveyed? Are they, by means preternatural, procurers of
salvation? Have they a mystical action towards this end?
If so, we return to the same point; they have a charmed
efficacy on the human soul.</p>

<p>In order to establish this, nothing more is requisite than a
brief reference to the language of the Articles and Liturgical
services of the Church respecting Baptism and the Communion.</p>

<p>Baptism is regarded, throughout the Book of Common
Prayer, as the instrument of regeneration: not simply as its
sign, of which the actual descent of the Holy Spirit is independent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
but as itself and essentially the means or indispensable
occasion of the washing away of sin. That this is
regarded as a mystical and magical, not a natural and spiritual
effect, is evident from the alleged fact of its occurrence
in infants, to whom the rite can suggest nothing, and on
whom, in the course of nature, it can leave no impression.
Yet it is declared of the infant, after the use of the water,
"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that <i>this child is regenerate</i>,"
&amp;c.: at the commencement of the service its aim
is said to be that God may "grant to this child that thing
which by nature he cannot have,"&mdash;"would wash him and
sanctify him with the Holy Ghost," that he may be "delivered
from God's wrath." Nothing, indeed, is so striking in
this office of the national Church, as its audacious trifling
with solemn names, denoting qualities of the soul and will;
the ascription of spiritual and moral attributes, not only to
the child in whom they can yet have no development, but
even to material substances; the frivolity with which engagements
with God are made by deputy, and without the consent
or even existence of the engaging will. Water is said
to possess <i>sanctity</i>, for "the mystical washing away of sin."
Infants, destitute of any idea of duty or obligation to be resisted
or obeyed, are said to obtain "<i>remission of their sins</i>";&mdash;to
"renounce the Devil and all his works, the vain pomp
and glory of the world"; "steadfastly to believe" in the
Apostles' Creed, and to be desirous of "baptism into this
faith." Belief, desire, resolve, are acts of some one's mind:
the language of this service attributes them to the personality
of the infant (<i>I</i> renounce, <i>I</i> believe, <i>I</i> desire); yet there they
cannot possibly exist. If they are to be understood as affirmed
by the godfathers and godmothers of themselves, the
case is not improved: for how can one person's state of faith
and conscience be made the condition of the regeneration of
another? What intelligible meaning can be attached to these
phrases of sanctity applied to an age not responsible? In
what sense, and by what indication, are these children <i>holier</i>
than others? And with what reason, if all this be Christianity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
can we blame the Pope for sprinkling holy water on
the horses? The service appears little better than a profane
sacerdotal jugglery, by which material things are impregnated
with divine virtues, moral and spiritual qualities of the mind
are sported with, the holy spirit of God is turned into a
physical mystery, and the solemnity of personal responsibility
is insulted.</p>

<p>That a superstitious value is attributed to the details of
the baptismal form, in the Church of England, appears from
certain parts of the service for the private ministration of the
rite. If a child has been baptized by any other lawful minister
than the minister of the parish, strict inquiries are to
be instituted by the latter respecting the correctness with
which the ceremony has been performed; and should the
prescribed rules have been neglected, the baptism is invalid,
and must be repeated. Yet great solicitude is manifested,
lest danger should be incurred by an unnecessary repetition
of the sacrament: to guard against which, the minister is to
give the following conditional invitation to the Holy Spirit;
saying, in his address to the child, "<i>If</i> thou art not already
baptized, I baptize thee," &amp;c. It is worthy of remark, that
the Church mentions as one of the <i>essentials</i> of the service,
the omission of which necessitates its repetition, the use of
the formula, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost." By this rule, every one of the apostolic
baptisms recorded in Scripture must be pronounced invalid;
and the Church of England, were it possible, would
perform them again: for in no instance does it appear that
the Apostles employed either this or even any equivalent
form of words.</p>

<p>That this sacrament is regarded as an indispensable channel
of grace, and positively necessary to salvation, is clear from
the provision of a short and private form, to be used in cases
of extreme danger. The prayers, and faith, and obedience,
and patient love, of parents and friends,&mdash;the dedication and
heart-felt surrender of their child to God, the profound application
of their anxieties and grief to their conscience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
inward life,&mdash;all this, we are told, will be of no avail, without
the water and the priest. Archbishop Laud says: "That
baptism is necessary to the salvation of infants (in the ordinary
way of the Church, without binding God to the use
and means of that sacrament, to which he hath bound us), is
expressed in St. John iii., 'Except a man be born of water,'
&amp;c. So, no baptism, no entrance; nor can infants creep in,
any other ordinary way."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Bishop Bramhall says: "Wilful
neglect of baptism we acknowledge to be a damnable sin;
and, without repentance and God's extraordinary mercy, to
exclude a man from all hope of salvation. But yet, if such
a person, before his death, shall repent and deplore his neglect
of the means of grace, from his heart, and desire with
all his soul to be baptized, but is debarred from it invincibly,
we do not, we dare not, pass sentence of condemnation upon
him; not yet the Roman Catholics themselves. The question
then is, whether the want of baptism, upon invincible
necessity, do evermore infallibly exclude from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Singular struggle here, between the merciless ritual of the
priest, and the relenting spirit of the man!</p>

<p>The office of Communion contains even stronger marks of
the same sacerdotal superstitions; and, notwithstanding the
Protestant horror entertained of the mass, approaches it so
nearly, that no ingenuity can exhibit them in contrast. Near
doctrines, however, like near neighbors, are known to quarrel
most.</p>

<p>The idea of a physical sanctity, residing in solid and liquid
substances, is encouraged by this service. The priest <i>consecrates</i>
the elements, by laying his hand upon all the bread,
and upon every flagon containing the wine about to be dispensed.
If an additional quantity is required, this too must
be consecrated before its distribution. And the sacredness
thus imparted is represented as surviving the celebration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Supper, and residing in the substances as a permanent
quality: for in the disposal of the bread and wine that may
remain at the close of the sacramental feast, a distinction is
made between the consecrated and the unconsecrated portion
of the elements; the former is not permitted to quit the
altar, but is to be reverently consumed by the priest and the
communicants; the latter is given to the curate. What the
particular change may be, which the prayer and manipulation
of the minister are thought to induce, it is by no means easy
to determine; nor would the discovery, perhaps, reward our
pains. It is certainly conceived, that they cease to be any
longer mere bread and wine, and that with them thenceforth
co-exist, really and substantially, the body and blood of
Christ. Respecting this <i>Real Presence</i> with the elements,
there is no dispute between the Romish and the English
Church; both unequivocally maintain it: and the only question
is, respecting the <i>Real Absence</i> of the original and culinary
bread and wine; the Roman Catholic believing that
these substantially vanish, and are replaced by the body and
blood of Christ; the English Protestant conceiving that they
remain, but are united with the latter. The Lutheran, no
less than the British Reformed Church, has clung tenaciously
to the doctrine of the real presence in the Eucharist, Luther
himself declares: "I would rather retain, with the Romanists,
<i>only</i> the body and blood, than adopt, with the Swiss, the
bread and wine, <i>without</i> the real body and blood of Christ."
The catechism of our Church affirms that "the body and
blood of Christ are <i>verily and indeed</i> taken and received by
the faithful in the Lord's Supper." And this was not intended
to be figuratively understood, of the spiritual use and
appropriation to which the faith and piety of the receiver
would mentally convert the elements: for although here the
body of Christ is only said to be "<i>taken</i>" (making it the <i>act
of the communicant</i>), yet one of the Articles speaks of it as
"<i>given</i>" (making it the <i>act of the officiating priest</i>), and implying
the real presence <i>before participation</i>. However
anxious, indeed, the clergy of the "Evangelical" school may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
be to disguise the fact, it cannot be doubted that their
Church has always maintained a supernatural change in the
elements themselves, as well as in the mind of the receiver.
Cosin, Bishop of Durham, says, "We own the union between
the body and blood of Christ, and the elements, whose use
and office we hold to be changed from what it was before";
"we confess the necessity of a supernatural and heavenly
change, and that the signs cannot become sacraments but by
the infinite power of God."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In consistency with this preparatory change, a charmed
efficacy is attributed to the subsequent participation in the
elements. Even the <i>body</i> of the communicant is said to be
under their influence: "Grant us to eat the flesh of thy
dear Son, and drink his blood, that our sinful <i>bodies</i> may be
made clean through his body, and our <i>souls</i> washed through
his most precious blood"; and the unworthy recipients are
said "to provoke God to plague them with divers diseases
and sundry kinds of death." Lest the worshipper, by presenting
himself in an unqualified state, should "do nothing
else than increase his damnation," the unquiet conscience is
directed to resort to the priest, and receive the benefit of absolution
before communicating. Can we deny to the Oxford
divines the merit (whatever it may be) of consistency with
the theology of their Church, when they applaud and recommend,
as they do, the administration of the Eucharist to infants,
and to persons dying and insensible? Indeed, it is
difficult to discover why infant Communion should be thought
more irrational than infant Baptism. If, as I have endeavored
to show, the primary action of these ceremonies is conceived
to be on God, not on the mind of their object, why
should not the Divine blessing be induced upon the young
and the unconscious, as well as on the mature and capable
soul? And were any further evidence required than I have
hitherto adduced, to show <i>on whom</i> the Communion is conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to operate in the first instance, it would surely be
afforded by this clause in the Service: by not partaking,
"<i>Consider how great an injury ye do unto God.</i>"</p>

<p>The only thing wanted to complete this sacerdotal system,
is to obtain for a certain class of men the corporate possession,
and exclusive administration, of these essential and holy
mysteries. This our Church accomplishes by its doctrine of
Apostolical Succession; claiming for its ministers a lineal
official descent from the Apostles, which invests them, and
them alone within this realm, with divine authority to pronounce
absolution or excommunication, and to administer the
Sacraments. They are thus the sole guardians of the channels
of the Divine Spirit and its grace, and interpose themselves
between a nation and its God. "Receive the Holy
Ghost," says the Service for Ordination of Priests, "for the
office and work of a priest in the Church of God, now committed
unto thee by the imposition of hands. Whose sins
thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost
retain, they are retained." "They only," says the present
Bishop of Exeter, "can claim to rule over the Lord's household,
whom he has himself placed over it; they only are able
to minister the means of grace,&mdash;above all, to present the
great commemorative <i>sacrifice</i>,&mdash;whom Christ has appointed,
and whom he has in all generations appointed in unbroken
succession from those, and through those, whom he first ordained.
'Ambassadors from Christ' must, by the very force
of the term, receive credentials from Christ: 'stewards of the
mysteries of God' must be intrusted with those mysteries by
him. Remind your people, that in the Church only is the
promise of forgiveness of sins; and though, to all who truly
repent, and sincerely believe, Christ mercifully grants forgiveness,
yet he has, in an especial manner, empowered his ministers
to declare and pronounce to his people the absolution and
remission of their sins: 'Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are
retained.' This was the awful authority given to his first
ministers, and in them, and through them, to all their successors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
This is the awful authority we have received, and
that we must never be ashamed nor afraid to tell the people
that we have received.</p>

<p>"Having shown to the people your commission, show to
them how our own Church has framed its services in accordance
with that commission. Show this to them not only in
the Ordinal, but also in the Collects, in the Communion Service,
in the Office of the Visitation of the Sick; show it, especially,
in that which continually presents itself to their notice,
but is commonly little regarded by them; show it in the
very commencement of Morning and Evening Prayer, and
make them understand the full blessedness of that service, in
which the Church thus calls on them to join. Let them see
that there the minister authoritatively pronounces God's
pardon and absolution to all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly
believe Christ's holy Gospel; that he does this, even
as the Apostles did, with the authority and by the appointment
of our Lord himself, who, in commissioning his Apostles,
gave this to be the never-failing assurance of his co-operation
in their ministry: 'Lo, I am with you always, even
unto the end of the world'; a promise which, of its very
nature, was not to be fulfilled to the persons of those whom
he addressed, but to their office, to their successors therefore
in that office, 'even unto the end of the world.' Lastly,
remind and warn them of the awful sanction with which our
Lord accompanied his mission, even of the second order of the
ministers whom he appointed: 'He that heareth you, heareth
me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that
despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.'" That this high
dignity may be clearly understood to belong in this country
only to the Church of England, the Bishop proposes the
question, "What, then, becomes of those who are not, or
continue not, members of that (visible) Church?" and replies
to it by saying, that though he "judges not them that are
without," yet "he who wilfully and in despite of due warning,
or through recklessness and worldly-mindedness, sets at naught
its ordinances, and despises its ministers, has no right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
promise to himself any share in the grace which they are
appointed to convey."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "Why," says one of the Oxford
divines, who here undeniably speaks the genuine doctrine of
his Church,&mdash;"Why should we talk so much of an <i>Establishment</i>,
and so little of an <span class="smcap">Apostolic Succession</span>? Why
should we not seriously endeavor to impress our people with
this plain truth, that, by separating themselves from our communion,
they separate themselves not only from a decent,
orderly, useful society, but from <span class="smcap">the only Church in
this realm which has a right to be quite sure
that she has the Lord's body to give to his people</span>?"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Of course this divine authority has been received through
the Church of Rome, so abominable in the eyes of all Evangelical
clergymen; and through many an unworthy link in
the broken chain. The Holy Spirit, it is acknowledged, has
<i>passed through</i> many, on whom, apparently, it was not pleased
to rest; and the right to forgive sins been conferred by those
who seemed themselves to need forgiveness. A writer in
the Oxford Tracts observes: "Nor even though we may admit
that many of those who formed the connecting links of this
holy chain were themselves unworthy of the high charge
reposed in them, can this furnish us with any solid ground
for doubting or denying their power to exercise that legitimate
authority with which they were duly invested, of transmitting
the sacred gift to worthier followers."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In its doctrine of Sacraments, then, and in that of ecclesiastical
authority and succession, the Church of England is
thoroughly imbued with the sacerdotal character. It doubtless
contains far better elements and nobler conceptions than
those which it has been my duty to exhibit now; and solemnly
insists on faith of heart, and truth of conscience, and
Christian devotedness of life, as well as on the observance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
its ritual; with the external it unites the internal condition of
sanctification. But insisting on the theory of a mystic efficacy
in the Christian rites, it necessarily fails to reconcile these
with each other: and hence the opposite parties within its
pale; the one magnifying faith and personal spirituality, the
other exalting the sacraments and ecclesiastical communion.
They represent respectively the two constituent and clashing
powers, which met at the formation of the English Church,
and of which it effected the mere compromise, not the reconciliation;
I mean, the priestliness of Rome, and the prophetic
spirit of the Reformers. Never, since apostolic days, did
Heaven bless us with truer prophet than Martin Luther. It
was his mission (no modern man had ever greater) to substitute
the idea of <i>personal faith</i> for that of <i>sacerdotal reliance</i>.
And gloriously, with bravery and truth of soul amid a thousand
hinderances, did he achieve it. But though, ever since,
the priests have been down, and faith has been up, yet did
the hierarchy unavoidably remain, and insisted that <i>something</i>
should be made of it, and at least some colorable terms proposed.
Hence, every reformed church exhibits a coalition
between the new and the old ideas: and combined views of
religion, which must ultimately prove incompatible with each
other; the formal with the spiritual; the idea of worship as
a means of propitiating God, with the conception of it as an
expression of love in man; the notion of Church authority
with that of individual freedom; the admission of a license
to think, with a prohibition of thinking wrong. In our national
Church the old spirit was ascendant over the new,
though long forced into quiescence by the temper of modern
times. Now it is attempting to reassert its power, not without
strenuous resistance. Indeed, the present age seems
destined to end the compromise between the two principles,
from the union of which Protestantism assumed its established
forms. The truce seems everywhere breaking up: a
general disintegration of churches is visible; tradition is ransacking
the past for claims and dignities, and canvassing
present timidity for fresh authority, to withstand the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
forces born at the Reformation, and hurrying us fast into an
unknown future.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the primitive Christianity; which, I
submit, is throughout wholly anti-sacerdotal.</p>

<p>Surely it must be admitted that the general spirit of our
Lord's personal life and ministry was that of the Prophet,
not of the Priest; tending directly to the disparagement of
whatever priesthood existed in his country, without visibly
preparing the substitution of anything at all analogous to it.
The sacerdotal order felt it so; and, with the infallible instinct
of self-preservation, they watched, they hated, they seized,
they murdered him. The priest in every age has a natural
antipathy to the prophet, dreads him as kings dread revolution,
and is the first to detect his existence. The solemn moment
and the gracious words of Christ's first preaching in Nazareth,
struck with fate the temple in Jerusalem. To the old men
of the village, to the neighbors who knew his childhood, and
companions who had shared its rambles and its sports, he
said, with the quiet flush of inspiration: "The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
Gospel to the poor: he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted,
to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are
bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." The
Spirit of the Lord in Galilee! speaking with the peasantry,
dwelling in villages, and wandering loose and where it listeth
among the hills! This would never do, thought the white-robed
Levites of the Holy City; it would be as a train of
wildfire in the temple. And were they not right? When
it was revealed that sanctity is no thing of place and time,
that a way is open from earth to heaven, from every field or
mountain trod by human feet, and through every roof that
shelters a human head; that, amid the crowd and crush of
life, each soul is in personal solitude with God, and by speech
or silence (be they but true and loving) may tell its cares and
find its peace; that a divine allegiance might <i>cost nothing</i>,
but the strife of a dutiful will and the patience of a filial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
heart,&mdash;how could any priesthood hope to stand? See how
Jesus himself, when the temple was close at hand, and the
sunshine dressed it in its splendor, yet withdrew his prayers
to the midnight of Mount Olivet. He entered those courts
to teach, rather than to worship; and when there, he is felt
to take no consecration, but to give it; to bring with him the
living spirit of God, and spread it throughout all the place.
When evening closes his teachings, and he returns late over
the Mount to Bethany, did he not feel that there was more of
God in the night-breeze on his brow, and the heaven above
him, and the sad love within him, than in the place called
"Holy" which he had left? And when he had knocked at
the gate of Lazarus the risen and become his guest,&mdash;when,
after the labors of the day, he unburdened his spirit to the
affections of that family, and spake of things divine to the
sisters listening at his feet,&mdash;did they not feel, as they retired
at length, that the whole house was full of God, and that there
is no sanctuary like the shrine, not made with hands, within
us all? In childhood, he had once preferred the temple and
its teachings to his parents' home: now, to his deeper experience,
the temple has lost its truth; while the cottage and
the walks of Nazareth, the daily voices and constant duties
of this life, seem covered with the purest consecration. True,
he vindicated the sanctity of the temple, when he heard within
its enclosure the hum of traffic and the chink of gain, and
would not have the house of prayer turned into a place of
merchandise: because in this there was imposture and a lie,
and Mammon and the Lord must ever dwell apart. In
nothing must there be mockery and falsehood; and while
the temple stands, it must be a temple true.</p>

<p>Our Lord's whole ministry, then, (to which we may add
that of his Apostles,) was conceived in a spirit quite opposite
to that of priesthood. A missionary life, without fixed locality,
without form, without rites; with teaching free, occasional,
and various, with sympathies ever with the people,
and a strain of speech never marked by invective, except
against the ruling sacerdotal influence;&mdash;all these characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
proclaim him, purely and emphatically, the Prophet of the
Lord. It deserves notice that, unless as the name of his
enemies, the <i>word</i> "<span class="smcap">Priest</span>" (ἱερευς) never occurs in either
the historical or epistolary writings of the New Testament,
except in the Epistle to the Hebrews. And <i>there</i> its application
is not a little remarkable. It is applied to Christ alone;
it is declared to belong to him only after his ascension; it is
said that, while on earth, he neither was, nor could be, a
priest; and if it is admitted that he holds the office in heaven,
this is only to satisfy the demand of the Hebrew Christians
for some sacerdotal ideas in their religion, and to reconcile
them to having no priest on earth. The writer acknowledges
one great pontiff in the world above, that the whole race may
be superseded in the world below; and banishes priesthood
into invisibility, that men may never see its shadow more.
All the terms of office which are given to the first preachers
of the Gospel and superintendents of churches,&mdash;as Deacon,
Elder or Presbyter, Overseer or Bishop,&mdash;are <i>lay terms</i>, belonging
previously, not to ecclesiastical, but to civil life; an
indication, surely, that no analogy was thought to exist between
the Apostolic and the Sacerdotal relations.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I shall,
no doubt, be reminded of the words, in which our Lord is
supposed to have given their commission to his first representatives:
"Whatsoever ye bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever ye loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven"; and shall be asked whether this does not convey
to them and their successors an official authority to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
forgive sins, and dispense the decrees of the unseen world.
I reply briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the power here granted does not relate to the
dispensations of the future life, but solely to what would be
termed, in modern language, the allotment of <i>church-membership</i>.
The previous verse proves this, furnishing as it does
a particular case of the general authority here assigned. It
directs the Apostles under what circumstances they are to
remove an offender from a Christian society, and treat him as
an unconverted man, as a heathen man and a publican.
Having given them their rule, he freely trusts the application
of it to them: and being about to retire erelong from personal
intervention in the affairs of his kingdom, he assures
them that their decisions shall be his, and that he may be
considered as adopting in heaven their determinations upon
earth. He simply "consigns to his Apostles discretionary
power to direct the affairs of his Church, and superintend the
diffusion of the glad tidings: they may bind and loose, that
is, open and shut the door of admission to their community,
as their judgment may determine; employing or rejecting
applicants for the missionary office; dissociating from their
assemblies obstinate delinquents; receiving with openness, or
dismissing with suspicion, each candidate for instruction, according
to their estimate of his qualifications and motives."</p>

<p>2dly. It is to be observed, that there is no appearance of any
one being in the contemplation of our Lord, beyond the persons
immediately addressed. Not a word is said of any official
successor or any distant age. No indication is afforded, that
any idea of futurity was present to the mind of Jesus: and
a title of perpetual office, an instrument creating and endowing
an endless priesthood, ought, it will be admitted, to be
somewhat more explicit than this. But where the power
has been successfully claimed, the title is seldom difficult to
prove.</p>

<p>The alleged <span class="smcap">ritual</span> of Christianity, consisting of the sacraments
of Baptism and the Communion, will be found no less
destitute of sanction from the Scriptures. The former we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
shall see reason to regard as simply an initiatory form, applicable
only to Christian converts, and limited therefore to
adults; the latter as purely a commemoration: neither therefore
having any sacramental or mystical efficacy.</p>

<p>For baptism it is impossible to establish any supernatural
origin. It is admitted to have existed before the Christian
era; and to have been employed by the Jews on the admission
of proselytes to their religion. It is certain that it is
not an enjoined rite in the Mosaic dispensation; and, though
prevalent before the period of the New Testament, is nowhere
enforced or recognized in the writings of the Old. It arose
therefore in the interval between the only two systems which
Christians acknowledged to be supernatural; and must be
considered as of natural and human origin, invested, thus far,
with no higher authority than its own appropriateness may
confer. There seem to have been two modes of construing
the symbol: the one founded on the cleansing effect of the
water on the person of the baptized himself; the other, on
the appearance of his immersion (which was complete) to the
eye of a spectator. The former was an image of the heathen
convert's purification from a foul idolatry, and his transition
to a stainless condition under a divine and justifying law.
The latter represented him, when he vanished in the stream,
as interred to this world, sunk utterly from its sight; and
when he reappeared, as emerging or born again to a better
state; the "old man" was "buried in baptism," and when
he "rose again," he had altogether "become new."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ceremony then was appropriately used in any case of transition
from a depressed and corrupt state of existence to a
hopeful and blessed one; from a false or imperfect religion to
one true and heavenly.</p>

<p>But it will be said, whatever the origin of baptism, it was
employed and sanctioned by our Lord, who commissioned
his Apostles to go and baptize all nations. True; but is there
no difference between the adoption of a practice already extant,&mdash;of
a practice which was as much the mere institutional
dress of the Apostles' nation, as the sandals whose dust they
were to shake off against the faithless were the customary
clothing of the Apostles' feet,&mdash;and the authoritative appointment
of a sacrament? They were going forth to make converts:
and why should they not have recourse to the form
familiarly associated with the act? Familiar association recommended
its adoption in that age and clime; and the absence
of such association elsewhere and in other times may
be thought to justify its disuse. At all events, a ceremony
thus taken up must be presumed to retain its acquired sense
and its established extent of application: and if so, baptism
must be strictly limited to the admission of proselytes from
other faiths. This accords with the known practice of the
Apostles, who cannot be shown to have baptized any but
those whom they had personally, or by their missionaries,
persuaded to become Christians. Not a single case of the
use of the rite with children can be adduced from Scripture;
and the only argument by which such employment of it is
ever justified is this: that a <i>household</i> is said to have been
baptized, and <i>all nations</i> were to receive the offer of it; and
that the household <i>may</i>, the nations <i>must</i>, have contained children.
It is evident that such reasoning could never have
been propounded, unless the practice had existed first, and
the defence had been found afterwards.</p>

<p>With the system of infant baptism vanish almost all the
ideas which the prevalent theology has put into the rite; and
it becomes as intelligible and expressive to one who believes
in the good capacities of human nature, as to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
esteem it originally depraved. "How unmeaning," say our
Orthodox opponents, "is this ceremony in Unitarian hands,
denying, as they do, the doctrines which it represents! Of
what regeneration can they possibly suppose it the symbol, if
not of the washing away of that <i>hereditary sin</i> which they
refuse to acknowledge? for when the infant is brought to the
font, he can as yet have no other guilt than this." I reply,
the objection has no force except against the use of <i>infant</i>
baptism in our churches,&mdash;which I am not anxious to defend;
but of course those Unitarians who employ it conceive it to
be the token, not of any sentiments which they reject, but of
truths and feelings which they hold dear. For myself, I
believe, with our opponents, that the <i>doctrine</i> of original sin
and the <i>practice</i> of infant baptism <i>do</i> belong to each other,
and must stand or fall together; and therefore deem it a fact
very significant of the Apostles' theology, that no infant can
be shown ever to have been "brought to the font" by these
first true missionaries of Christianity. And as to the <i>new
birth</i> which baptism (i. e. recent and genuine discipleship to
Jesus) may give to the <i>maturely convinced</i> Christian, he must
have a great deal to learn, not only of the Hebrew conceptions
and language in relation to the Messiah, but of the
spirituality of the Gospel, and of the fresh creations of character
which it calls up, who can be much puzzled about its
meaning.</p>

<p>In Christian baptism, then, we have no sacrament with
mystic power; but an initiatory form, possibly of consuetudinary
obligation only; but if enjoined, applicable exclusively
to proselytes, and misemployed in the case of infants; a sign
of conversion, not a means of salvation; confided to no sacerdotal
order, but open to every man fitted to give it an
appropriate use.</p>

<p>I turn to the Lord's Supper; with design to show what it
is not, and what it is. It is not a mystery, or a sacrament,
any more than it is an expiatory sacrifice. To persuade us
that it has a ritual character, we are first assured that it is
clearly the successor in the Gospel to the Passover under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Law. Well, even if it were so, it would still be simply
commemorative, and without any other efficacy than a festival,
filled with great remembrances, and inspired with religious
joy. Such was the Paschal Feast in Jerusalem; the
annual gathering of families and kindred, a sacred carnival
under the spring sky and in sight of unreaped fields, when
the memory was recalled of national deliverance, and the tale
was told of traditional glories, and the thoughts brought back
of bondage reversed, of the desert pilgrimage ended, of the
promised land possessed. The Jewish festival was no more
than this; unless, with Archbishop Magee and others, we
erroneously conceive it to be a proper sacrifice. So that
those who would interpret the Lord's Supper by the Passover
have their choice between two views: that it is a simple
commemoration; or that it is an expiatory sacrifice: in the
former case they quit the Church of England; in the latter,
they fall into the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>But, in truth, there is no propriety in applying the name
"Christian Passover" to the Communion. The notion rests
entirely on this circumstance: that the first three Evangelists
describe the last Supper as the Paschal Supper. But the <i>institutional</i>
part of that meal was over before the cup was distributed,
and the repetition of the act enjoined. Nor is there
the slightest trace, either in the subsequent Scriptures, or in
the earliest history of the Church, that the Communion was
thought to bear relation to the Passover. The time, the frequency,
the mode, of the two were altogether different. Indeed,
when we observe that not one of these particulars is
prescribed and determined by our Lord at all, when we notice
the slight and transient manner in which he drops his
wish that they would "do this in remembrance of" him, when
we compare these features of the account with the elaborate
precision of Moses respecting hours, and materials, and dates,
and places, and modes in the establishment of the Hebrew
festivals, it is scarcely possible to avoid the impression, that
we are reading narrative, not law; an utterance of personal
affection, rather than the legislative enactment of an everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
institution. However this may be, no importance
can be attached to the reported coincidence in the time of
that meal with the day of Passover; for the Apostle John,
who gives by far the fullest account of what happened at
that table (yet never mentions the institution of the Supper),
states that this was not the paschal meal at all, which did
not occur, he says, till the following day of crucifixion.</p>

<p>"But," it will be said, "the Gospels are not the only parts
of Scripture whence the nature of the Eucharist may be
learned. Language is employed by St. Paul in reference to
it, which cannot be understood of a mere memorial, and implies
that awful consequences hung on the worthy or unworthy
participation in the rite. Does he not even say, that a
man may 'eat and drink damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord's body'?"</p>

<p>The passage whence these words are cited certainly throws
great light on the institution of which we treat; but there
must be a total disregard to the whole context and the general
course of the Apostle's reasoning before it can be made
to yield any argument for the mystical character of the rite.
It would appear that the Corinthian church was in the habit
of celebrating the Lord's Supper in a way which, even if it
had never been disgraced by any indecorum, must have struck
a modern Christian with wonder at its singularity. The
members met together in one room or church, each bringing
his own supper, of such quantity and quality as his opulence
or poverty might allow. To this the Apostle does not object,
but apparently considers it a part of the established arrangement.
But these Christians were divided into factions, and
had not learned the true uniting spirit of their faith; nor do
they seem to have acquired that sobriety of habit and sanctity
of mind which their profession ought to have induced.
When they entered the place of meeting, they broke up into
groups and parties, class apart from class, and rich deserting
poor: each set began its separate meal, some indulging in
luxury and excess, others with scarce the means of keeping
the commemoration at all; and, infamous to tell, the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Supper of the Lord was sunk into a tavern meal. So gross
and habitual had the abuse become, that the excesses had
affected the health and life of these guilty and unworthy partakers.
They had made no distinction between the Communion
and an ordinary repast, had lost all perception of
the memorial significance of their meeting, had not discriminated
or "discerned the Lord's body"; and so they had eaten
and drunk judgment (improperly rendered "<i>damnation</i>" in
the English Version) to themselves; and many were weak
and sickly among them, and many even slept. Well would
it be, if they would look on this as a chastening of the Lord;
in which case they might take warning, and escape being cast
out of the Church, and driven to take their chance with the
unbelieving and heathen world. "When we are judged, we
are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned
with the world."</p>

<p>In order to remedy all this corruption, St. Paul reminds
them, that to eat and drink under the same roof, in the
church, does not constitute proper Communion; that, to this
end, they must not break up into sections, and retain their
property in the food, but all participate seriously together.
He directs that an absolute separation shall be made between
the occasions for satisfying hunger and thirst, and those for
observing this commemorative rite, discriminating carefully
the memorial of the Lord's body from everything else. He
refers them all to the original model of the institution, the
parting meal of Christ before his betrayal; and by this example,
as a criterion, he would have every man examine himself,
and after that pattern eat of the bread and drink of the
cup. Hence it appears,&mdash;</p>

<p>That the unworthy partaker was the riotous Corinthian,
who made no distinction between the sacred Communion and
a vulgar meal:</p>

<p>That the judgment or damnation which such brought on
themselves, was sickliness, weakness, and premature but natural
death:</p>

<p>That the self-examination which the Apostle recommends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to the communicant is a comparison of his mode of keeping
the rite with the original model of the last Supper:</p>

<p>That in the Corinthian church there was no Priest, or
officiating dispenser of the elements; and that St. Paul did
not contemplate or recommend the appointment of any such
person.</p>

<p>The Lord's Supper, then, I conclude, was and is a simple
commemoration. Am I asked: "<i>Of what</i>? Why, according
to Unitarian views, the death on the cross merits the
memorial more than the remaining features of our Lord's
history,&mdash;more even than the death of many a noble martyr,
who has sealed his testimony to truth by like self-sacrifice"?
The answer will be found at length in the Lecture on the
Atonement, where the Scriptural conceptions of Christ's
death are expounded in detail. Meanwhile, it is sufficient
to recall an idea, which has more than once been thrown
out during this course; that, if Jesus had taken up his
Messianic power without death, he would have remained a
Hebrew, and been limited to the people amid whom he was
born. He quitted his mortal personality, he left this fleshly
tabernacle of existence, and became immortal, that his nationality
might be destroyed, and all men drawn in as subjects
of his reign. It was the cross that opened to the
nations the blessed ways of life, and put us all in relations,
not of law, but of love, to him and God. Hence the memorial
of his death celebrates the universality and spirituality of
the Gospel; declares the brotherhood of men, the fatherhood
of providence, the personal affinity of every soul with God.
That is no empty rite which overflows with these conceptions.</p>

<p>Christianity, then, I maintain, is without Priest and without
Ritual. It altogether coalesces with the prophetic idea
of religion, and repudiates the sacerdotal. Christ himself
was transcendently <span class="smcap">the Prophet</span>. He brought down God
to this our life, and left his spirit amid its scenes. The
Apostles were prophets; they carried that spirit abroad, revealing
everywhere to men the sanctity of their nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the proximity of their heaven. Nor am I even unwilling to
admit an apostolic succession, never yet extinct, and never
more to be extinguished. But then it is by no means a rectilinear
regiment of incessant priests; but a broken, scattered,
yet glorious race of prophets; the genealogy of great and
Christian souls, through whom the primitive conceptions of
Jesus have propagated themselves from age to age; mind
producing mind, courage giving birth to courage, truth developing
truth, and love ever nurturing love, so long as one
good and noble spirit shall act upon another. Luther surely
was the child of Paul; and what a noble offspring has risen
to manhood from Luther's soul, whom to enumerate were
to tell the best triumphs of the modern world. These are
Christ's true ambassadors; and never did he mean any follower
of his to be called a priest. He has his genuine messenger,
wherever, in the Church or in the world, there toils
any one of the real prophets of our race; any one who can
create the good and great in other souls, whether by truth of
word or deed, by the inspiration of genuine speech, or the
better power of a life merciful and holy.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here, my friends, with my subject might my Lecture
close, were it not that we are assembled now to terminate
this controversy; and that a few remarks in reference to its
whole course and spirit seem to be required.</p>

<p>That the recent aggression upon the principles of Unitarian
Christianity was prompted by no unworthy motive, individual
or political, but by a zeal, Christian so far as its
spirit is disinterested, and unchristian only so far as it is exclusive,
has never been doubted or denied by my brother
ministers or myself. That much personal consideration and
courtesy have been evinced towards us during the controversy,
it is so grateful to us to acknowledge, that we must only regret
the theological obstructions in the way of that mutual
knowledge which softens the prejudices and corrects the
errors of the closet. From such errors, the lot of our fallible
nature, we are deeply aware that we cannot be exempt, and
profoundly wish that, by others' aid or by our own, we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
discover them. Meanwhile, we do not feel that our opponents
have been successful in the offer which they have made,
of help towards this end. They are too little acquainted with
our history and character, and have far too great a horror of
us, to succeed in a design demanding rather the benevolence
of sympathy and trust than that of antipathy and
fear. Hence have arisen certain complaints and charges
against our system and its tendencies, which, having been
reiterated again and again in the Christ Church Lectures,
and scarcely noticed in our own, claim a concluding observation
or two now.</p>

<p>1. We are said to be infidels in disguise, and our system
to be drifting fast towards utter unbelief. At all events, it is
said we make great advances that way.</p>

<p>It is by no means unusual to dismiss this charge on a whirlwind
of declamation, designed to send it and the infidel to
the greatest possible distance. My friend who delivered the
first Lecture noticed it in a far different spirit; and in a discussion
where truth and wisdom had any chance, his reply
would have prevented any recurrence to the statement. Let
me try to imitate him in the testimony which I desire to add
upon this point.</p>

<p>Every one, I presume, who disbelieves <i>anything</i>, is, with
respect to that thing, <i>an infidel</i>. Departure from any prevalent
and established ideas is inevitably an approach to infidelity;
the extent of the departure, not the reasonableness
or propriety of it, is the sole measure of the nearness of that
approach; which, however wise and sober, when estimated
by a true and independent criterion, will appear, to persons
strongly possessed by the ascendant notions, nothing less
than alarming, amazing, awful. In short, the average popular
creed of the day is the mental standard, from which the
stadia are measured off towards that invisible, remote, nay,
even imaginary place, lodged somewhere within chaos, called
utter unbelief. Christianity at first was blank infidelity; and
disciples, being of course the atheists of their day, were
thought a fit prey for the wild beasts of the amphitheatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Every rejection of tradition, again, is unbelief with respect
to it; and to those who hold its authority, it is the denial of
an essential. It is too evident to need proof, that the average
popular belief cannot be assumed, by any considerate person,
as a standard of truth. To make it an objection against
any class of men, that they depart from it, is to prove no
error against them; and no one, who is not willing to call in
the passions of the multitude in suffrage on the controversies
of the few, will condescend to enforce the charge.</p>

<p>But only observe how, in the present instance, the matter
stands. In the popular religion we discern, mixed up together,
two constituent portions: certain <i>peculiar</i> doctrines
which characterize the common Orthodoxy; and certain <i>universal</i>
Christian truths remaining, when these are subtracted.
The infidel throws away both of these; we throw away the
former only; and thus far, no doubt, we partially agree with
him. But <i>on what grounds</i> do we severally justify this rejection?
In answer to this question, compare the views, with
respect both to the <i>authority</i> and to the <i>interpretation</i> of
Scripture, held by the three parties, the Trinitarian, the
Unbeliever, the Unitarian. The Unbeliever does not usually
find fault with the Orthodox <i>interpretation</i> of the Bible, but
allows it to pass, as probably the real meaning of the book,
only he altogether denies the divine character and authority
of the whole religion; he therefore <i>agrees</i> with the Trinitarian
respecting interpretation, disagrees with him respecting
<i>authority</i>. The Unitarian, again, admits the divine character
of Christianity, but understands it differently from the Trinitarian;
he therefore reverses the former case, <i>agrees</i> with
the Orthodox on the authority, <i>disagrees</i> respecting interpretation.
It follows, that with the Unbeliever he agrees <i>in
neither</i>, and is therefore farther from him than his Trinitarian
accuser.</p>

<p>I have given this explanation from regard simply to logical
truth. I have no desire to join in the outcry against
even the deliberate unbeliever in the Gospel, as if he must
necessarily be a fiend. Profoundly loving and trusting Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
myself, I yet feel indignant at the persecution which
theology, policy, and law inflict on the many who, with undeniable
exercise of conscientiousness and patience of research,
are yet unable to satisfy themselves respecting its
evidence. The very word "<i>infidel</i>," implying not simply an
intellectual judgment, but bad moral qualities, conveys an unmerited
insult, and ought to be repudiated by every generous
disputant. The more deeply we trust Christianity, the more
should we protest against its being defended by a body-guard
of passions, willing to do for it precisely the services which
they might equally render to the vulgarest imposture.</p>

<p>2. We were recently accused, amid acknowledgments of
our <i>honesty</i>, with want of <i>anxiety</i> about spiritual truth; and
the following justification of the charge was offered: "The
word of God has informed us, that they who seek the truth
shall find it; that they who ask for holy wisdom shall receive
it; but it must be a <i>really anxious inquiry</i>,&mdash;a heart-felt
desire for the blessing. 'If thou seekest her as silver,
and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou
understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of
God.' Such promises are express,&mdash;they cannot be broken,&mdash;God
will give the blessing to the <i>sincere</i>, <i>anxious</i> inquirer.
But the two qualities must go together. A man may be sincere
in his ignorance and spiritual torpor; but let the full
desire for God's favor, his pardoning mercy, and his enlightening
grace spring up in the heart, and we may rest
assured that the desire will soon be accomplished. Admitting,
then, the sincerity of Unitarians, we doubt their anxiety,
for we are well persuaded from God's promises, that, if they
possessed both, they would be delivered from their miserable
system, and be brought to the knowledge of the truth."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The praise of our "<i>sincerity</i>," conveyed in these bland
sentences, we are anxious to decline: not that we undervalue
the quality; but because we find, on near inspection, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
has all been emptied out of the word before its presentation,
and the term comes to us hollow and worthless. It affords a
specimen of the mode in which alone our opponents appear
able to give any credit to heretics: many phrases of approbation
they freely apply to us; but they take care to draw
off the whole meaning first. We must reject these "Greek
presents"; and we are concerned that any Christian divine
can so torture and desecrate the names of virtue, as to make
them instruments of disparagement and injury. This play
with words, which every conscience should hold sacred, and
every lip pronounce with reverence,&mdash;this careless and unmeaning
application of them in discourse,&mdash;indicates a loose
adhesion to the mind of the ideas denoted by them, which
we regard with unfeigned astonishment and grief. What,
let me ask, can be the "<i>sincerity</i>" of an inquirer, who is not
"<i>anxious</i>" <i>about the truth</i>? How can <i>he</i> be "<i>sincerely</i>" persuaded
that he sees, who voluntarily shuts his eyes? Unless
this word is to be degraded into a synonyme for indolence and
self-complacency, no professed seeker of truth must have the
praise of sincerity, who does not abandon all worship of his
own state of mind as already perfect, who is not ready to
listen to every calm doubt as to the voice of heaven,&mdash;to undertake
with gratitude the labor of reaching new knowledge,&mdash;to
maintain his faith and his profession in scrupulous
accordance with his perception of evidence; and, at any moment
of awakening, to spring from his most brilliant dreams
into God's own morning light, with a matin hymn upon his
lips for his new birth from darkness and from sleep. The
earnestness implied in this state of mind is perhaps not precisely
the same as that with which our Trinitarian opponents
seem to be familiar. The "anxiety" which they appear to
feel for themselves is, to keep their existing state of belief:
the "anxiety" which they feel for us is, that we should have
it. We are to hold ourselves ready for a change; they are
not to be expected to desire it. If a doubt of <i>our opinions</i>
should occur <i>to us</i>, we are to foster it carefully, and follow it
out as a beckoning of the Holy Spirit: if a doubt of <i>their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
sentiments</i> should occur <i>to them</i>, they are to crush it on the
spot, as a reptile-thought sent of Satan to tempt them. "Our
aim," says the concluding Lecturer again, "has been to beget
a deep spirit of inquiry";<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and so has ours, I would reply:
only you and we have severally prosecuted this aim in different
ways. We have personally listened, and personally
inquired, and earnestly recommended all whom our influence
could reach, to do the same: and few indeed will be the
Unitarian libraries containing one of these series of Lectures
that will not exhibit the other by its side. You have entered
this controversy, evidently strange to our literature and history;
and any deficiency in such reading before, has not
been compensated by anxiety to listen now. Your people
have been warned against us, and are taught to regard the
study of our publications as blasphemy at second hand; and
were they really so simple as to act upon your avowed wish
"to beget a deep spirit of inquiry," and plunge into the investigation
of Unitarian authors, and judge for themselves of
Unitarian worship, they would speedily hear the word of
recall, and discover that they were practically disappointing
the whole object of this controversy.</p>

<p>Having said thus much respecting the unmeaning use of
language in the Lecturer's disparaging estimate of Unitarian
"anxiety," we may profitably direct a moment's attention to
the <i>reasoning</i> which it involves. It presents us with the
standing fallacy of intolerance, which is sufficiently rebuked
by being simply exhibited. Our opponents reason thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">God will not permit the really anxious fatally to err:<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Unitarians <i>do</i> fatally err:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, The Unitarians are not really anxious.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now it is clear that we must conceive our opponents to be
no less mistaken than they suppose us to be. They are as
far from us, as we from them; and from either point, taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
as a standard, the measure of error must be the same. Moreover,
we cannot but eagerly assent to the principle of the
Lecturer's first premise, that God will never let the truly
anxious fatally miss their way. So that there is nothing, in
the nature of the case, to prevent our turning this same syllogism,
with a change in the names of the parties, against our
opponents. Yet we should shrink, with severe self-reproach,
from drawing any such unfavorable conclusion respecting
them, as they deduce of us. Accordingly, we manage our
reasoning thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">God will not permit the really anxious fatally to err:<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Trinitarians show themselves to be really anxious:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, The Trinitarians do not fatally err.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our opponents are more sure that their judgment is in the
right, than that their neighbors' conscience is in earnest.
They sacrifice other men's characters to their own self-confidence:
we would rather distrust our self-confidence, and
rely on the visible signs of a good and careful mind. We
honor other men's hearts, rather than our own heads. How
can it be just, to make the agreement between an opponent's
opinion and our own the criterion of his proper conduct of
the inquiry? Every man feels the injury the moment the
rule is turned against himself; and every good man should
be ashamed to direct it against his brother.</p>

<p>3. Our reverend opponents affect to have labored under
a great disadvantage, from the absence of any recognized
standard of Unitarian belief. "We give you," they say, "our
Articles and Creeds, which we unanimously undertake to
defend, and which expose a definite object to all heretical
attacks. In return, you can furnish us with no authorized
exposition of your system, but leave us to gather our knowledge
of it from individual writers, for whose opinions you
refuse to be responsible, and whose reasonings, when refuted
by us, you can conveniently disown."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>Plausible as this complaint may appear, I venture to affirm,
that it is vastly easier to ascertain the common belief of Unitarians,
than that of the members of the Established Church;
and for this plain reason, that with us there really is such a
thing as a common faith, though defined in no confession; in
the Anglican Church there is not, though articles and creeds
profess it. The characteristic tenets of Unitarian Christianity
are so simple and unambiguous, that little scope exists for
variety in their interpretation: to the propositions expressing
them all their professors attach <i>distinct and the same</i> ideas;&mdash;so
far, at least, as such accordance is possible in relation to
subjects inaccessible both to demonstration and to experience.
But the Trinitarian hypothesis, venturing with presumptuous
analysis far into the Divine psychology, presents us with
ideas confessedly inapprehensible; propounded in language
which, if used in its ordinary sense, is self-contradictory, and
if not, is unmeaning, and ready in its emptiness to be filled
by any arbitrary interpretation;&mdash;and actually understood so
variously by those who subscribe to them, that the Calvinist
and the Arminian, the Tritheist and the Sabellian, unite to
praise them. Indeed, in the history of the English Church,
so visible is the sweep of the centre of Orthodoxy over the
whole space from the confines of Romanism to the verge of
Unitarianism, that our ecclesiastical chronology is measured
by its oscillations. Our respected opponents know full well,
that it is not necessary to search beyond the clergy of this
town, or even beyond the morning and afternoon preaching
in one and the same church, in order to encounter greater
contrasts in theology, than could be found in a whole library
of Unitarian divinity. What mockery, then, to refer us to
these articles as expositions of clerical belief, when the moment
we pass beyond the words, and address ourselves to the
sense, every shade of contrariety appears; and no one definite
conception can be adopted of such a doctrine as that of the
Trinity, without some church expositor or other starting up
to rebuke it as a misrepresentation! How poor the pride of
uniformity, which contents itself with lip-service to the symbol,
in the midst of heart-burnings about the reality!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to test the force of the objection to which I am
referring, let us advert, in detail, to the topics which exhibit
the Unitarian and Trinitarian theology in most direct opposition.
It will appear that the advantage of unity lies, in this
instance, on the side of heresy; and that, if multiformity be
a prime characteristic of error, there is a wide difference
between orthodoxy and truth. There are four great subjects
comprised in the controversy between the Church and ourselves:
the nature of God; of Christ; of sin; of punishment.
On these several points (which, considered as involving on
our part denials of previous ideas, may be regarded as containing
the <i>negative</i> elements of our belief) all our modern
writers, without material variation or exception, maintain the
following doctrines:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Unitarian Doctrines</span>, <i>opposed to</i> <span class="smcap">Church Doctrines</span>.<br /><br /></th></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Suffering.</span></td><td align="left"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Torments.</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now no one at all familiar with polemical literature can
deny that the modes and ambiguities of doctrine comprised
in this Trinitarian list are more numerous than can be detected
in the parallel "heresies." I am willing, indeed, to
admit an exception in respect to the last of the topics, and to
allow that the belief in the finite duration of future punishment
has opposed itself, in two forms, to the single doctrine of
everlasting torments. But when the systems are compared
at their other corresponding points, the boast of orthodox
uniformity instantly vanishes. Since the primitive jealousy
between the Jewish and Gentile Christianity, the rivalry between
the "Monarchy" and the "Economy," the believers
in the personal unity of God, though often severed by ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
from each other, have held that majestic truth in one unvaried
form. Never was there an idea so often lost and recovered,
yet so absolutely unchanged: a sublime but occasional
visitant of the human mind, assuring us of the perpetual
oneness of our own nature, as well as the Divine. We can
point to no unbroken continuity of our great doctrine: and
if we could, we should appeal with no confidence to the
evidence of so dubious a phenomenon; for if a system of
ideas once gains possession of society, and attracts to itself
complicated interests and feelings, many causes may suffice
to insure its indefinite preservation. But we can point to a
greater phenomenon: to the long and repeated extinction of
our favorite belief, to its submersion beneath a dark and
restless fanaticism; and its invariable resurrection, like a
necessary intuition of the soul, in times of purer light, with
its features still the same; stamped with imperishable identity
of truth, and, like him to whom it refers, without variableness
or shadow of a turning. Meanwhile, who will undertake to
enumerate and define the succession of Trinities by which
this doctrine has been bewildered and banished? Passing
by the Aristotelian, the Platonic, the Ciceronian, the Cartesian
Trinity,&mdash;quitting the stormy disputes and contradictory
decisions of the early councils, shall we find among even the
modern fathers of our National Church any approach to
unanimity? Am I to be content with the doctrine of Bishop
Bull, and subordinate the Son to the Father as the sole fountain
of divinity? Or must I rise to the Tritheism of Waterland
and Sherlock? or, accepting the famous decision of the
University of Oxford, descend, with Archbishop Whately,
to the modal Trinity of South and Wallis? Are we to
understand the phrase, three persons, to mean three beings
united by "perichoresis," three "mutual inexistences," three
"modes," three "differences," three "contemplations," or
three "somewhats"; or, being told that this is but a vain
prying into a mystery, shall we be satisfied to leave the
phrase without idea at all? It is to the last degree astonishing
to hear from Trinitarian divines the praises of uniformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of belief; seeing that it is one of the chief labors of ecclesiastical
history to record the incessant effort, vain to the
present day, to give some stability of meaning to the fundamental
doctrines of their faith.</p>

<p>The same remark applies, with little modification, to the
opposite views respecting the person of the Saviour. It is
true, that Unitarians, agreed respecting the singleness of
nature in Christ, differ respecting the natural rank of that
nature, whether his soul were human or angelic. But, for
this solitary variety among these heretics, how many doctrines
of the Logos and the Incarnation does Orthodox
literature contain? Can any one affirm, that, when the Council
of Ephesus had arbitrated between the Eutychian doctrine
of absorption, and the Nestorian doctrine of separation,
all doubt and ambiguity was removed by the magic phrase
"hypostatic union"? Since the monophysite contest was
at its height, has the Virgin Mary been left in undisputed
possession of her title as "Mother of God"? Has the Eternal
Generation of the Son encountered no orthodox suspicions,
and the Indwelling scheme received no orthodox
support? And if we ask these questions: "What respectively
happened to the two natures on the cross? what has
become of Christ's human soul now? is it separate from the
Godhead, like any other immortal spirit, or is it added to the
Deity, so as to introduce into his nature a new and fourth
element?" shall we receive from the many voices of the
Church but one accordant answer? Nay, do the authors of
this controversy suppose that, during its short continuance,
they have been able to maintain their unanimity? If they
do, I believe that any reader who thinks it worth while to
register the varieties of error, would be able to undeceive
them. If the diversities of doctrine cannot easily and often
be shown to amount to palpable inconsistencies, this must be
ascribed, I believe, to the mystic and technical phraseology,
the substitute rather than the expression for precise ideas,&mdash;which
has become the vernacular dialect of orthodox divinity.
The jargon of theology affords a field too barren to bear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
vigorous a weed as an undisputed contradiction.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell on the numerous forms under which
the doctrine of Atonement has been held by those who subscribe
the articles of our National Church; while its Unitarian
opponents have taken their fixed station on the personal
character and untransferable nature of sin. One writer tells
us that only the human nature perished on the cross; another,
that God himself expired: some say, that Christ suffered no
more intensely, but only more "meritoriously," than many a
martyr; others, that he endured the whole quantity of torment
due to the wicked whom he redeemed: some, that it is
the spotlessness of his manhood that is imputed to believers;
others, that it is the holiness of his Deity. From the high
doctrine of satisfaction to the very verge of Unitarian heresy,
every variety of interpretation has been given to the language
of the established formularies respecting Christian redemption.
Nor is it yet determined whether, in the lottery of
opinion, the name of Owen, Sykes, or Magee shall be drawn
for the prize of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>And if, from those parts of our belief to which the accidents
of their historical origin have given a <i>negative</i> character,
we turn to those which are <i>positive</i>, not the slightest
reason will appear for charging them with uncertainty and
fluctuation. All Unitarian writers maintain the Moral Perfection
and Fatherly Providence of the Infinite Ruler; the
Messiahship of Jesus Christ, in whose person and spirit there
is a Revelation of God and a Sanctification for Man; the
Responsibility and Retributive Immortality of men; and the
need of a pure and devout heart of Faith, as the source of all
outward goodness and inward communion with God. These
great and self-luminous points, bound together by natural
affinity, constitute the fixed centre of our religion. And on
subjects beyond this centre we have no wider divergences
than are found among those who attach themselves to an
opposite system. For example, the relations between Scripture
and Reason, as evidences and guides in questions of doctrine,
are not more unsettled among us, than are the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
between Scripture and Tradition in the Church. Nor is the
perpetual authority of the "Christian rites" so much in
debate among our ministers, as the efficacy of the sacraments
among the clergy. In truth, our diversities of sentiment
affect far less <i>what</i> we believe, than the question <i>why</i> we
believe it. Different modes of reasoning, and different results
of interpretation, are no doubt to be found among our several
authors. We all make our appeal to the records of Christianity;
but we have voted no particular commentator into
the seat of authority. And is not this equally true of our
opponents' Church? Their articles and creeds furnish no
textual expositions of Scripture, but only results and deductions
from its study. And so variously have these results
been elicited from the sacred writings, that scarcely a text can
be adduced in defence of the Trinitarian scheme, which some
witness unexceptionably orthodox may not be summoned to
prove inapplicable. In fine, we have no greater variety of
critical and exegetical opinion than the divines from whom we
dissent; while the system of Christianity in which our Scriptural
labors have issued, has its leading characteristics better
determined and more apprehensible than the scheme which
the articles and creeds have vainly labored to define.</p>

<p>The refusal to embody our sentiments in any authoritative
formula appears to strike observers as a whimsical exception
to the general practice of churches. The peculiarity has had
its origin in hereditary and historical associations; but it has
its defence in the noblest principles of religious freedom and
Christian communion. At present, it must suffice to say,
that our societies are dedicated, not to theological opinions,
but to religious worship; that they have maintained the
unity of the spirit, without insisting on any unity of doctrine;
that Christian liberty, love, and piety are their essentials
in perpetuity, but their Unitarianism an accident of a
few or many generations,&mdash;which has arisen, and might
vanish, without the loss of their identity. We believe in the
mutability of religious systems, but the imperishable character
of the religious affections;&mdash;in the progressiveness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
opinion within, as well as without, the limits of Christianity.
Our forefathers cherished the same conviction; and so, not
having been born intellectual bondsmen, we desire to leave
our successors free. Convinced that uniformity of doctrine
can never prevail, we seek to attain its only good&mdash;peace on
earth and communion with Heaven&mdash;without it. We aim to
make a true Christendom,&mdash;a commonwealth of the faithful,&mdash;by
the binding force, not of ecclesiastical creeds, but of
spiritual wants and Christian sympathies; and indulge the
vision of a Church that "in the latter days shall arise," like
"the mountain of the Lord," bearing on its ascent the blossoms
of thought proper to every intellectual clime, and withal
massively rooted in the deep places of our humanity, and
gladly rising to meet the sunshine from on high.</p>

<p>And now, friends and brethren, let us say a glad farewell
to the fretfulness of controversy, and retreat again, with
thanksgiving, into the interior of our own venerated truth.
Having come forth, at the severer call of duty, to do battle
for it, with such force as God vouchsafes to the sincere, let
us go in to live and worship beneath its shelter. They tell
you it is not the true faith. Perhaps not; but then you
think it so; and that is enough to make your duty clear, and
to draw from it, as from nothing else, the very peace of God.
May be, we are on our way to something better, unexistent
and unseen as yet, which may penetrate our souls with nobler
affection, and give a fresh spontaneity of love to God and all
immortal things. Perhaps there cannot be the truest life of
faith, except in scattered individuals, till this age of conflicting
doubt and dogmatism shall have passed away. Dark and
leaden clouds of materialism hide the heaven from us; red
gleams of fanaticism pierce through, vainly striving to reveal
it; and not till the weight is heaved from off the air, and the
thunders roll down the horizon, will the serene light of God
flow upon us, and the blue infinite embrace us again. Meanwhile
we must reverently love the faith we have; to quit it for
one that we have not, were to lose the breath of life and die.</p>

REDEMPTION.</a></h2>

<blockquote class="matchind"><p>"Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."&mdash;Acts iv. 12.</p></blockquote>


<p>The scene which we have this evening to visit and explore,
is separated from us by the space of eighteen centuries; yet
of nothing on this earth has Providence left, within the
shadows of the past, so vivid and divine an image. Gently
rising above the mighty "field of the world," Calvary's
mournful hill appears, covered with silence now, but distinctly
showing the heavenly light that struggled there
through the stormiest elements of guilt. Nor need we only
gaze, as on a motionless picture that closes the vista of Christian
ages. Permitting history to take us by the hand, we
may pace back in pilgrimage to the hour, till its groups stand
around us, and pass by us, and its voices of passion and of
grief mock and wail upon our ear. As we mingle with the
crowd which, amid noise and dust, follows the condemned
prisoners to the place of execution, and fix our eye on the
faint and panting figure of one that bears his cross, could
we but whisper to the sleek priests close by, how might we
startle them, by telling them the future fate of this brief
tragedy,&mdash;brief in act, in blessing everlasting; that this
Galilean convict shall be the world's confessed deliverer,
while they that have brought him to this shall be the scorn
and by-word of the nations; that that vile instrument of torture,
now so abject that it makes the dying slave more servile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
shall be made, by this victim and this hour, the symbol of
whatever is holy and sublime; the emblem of hope and love;
pressed to the lips of ages; consecrated by a veneration which
makes the sceptre seem trivial as an infant's toy. Meanwhile,
the sacerdotal hypocrites, unconscious of the part they play,
watch to the end the public murder which they have privately
suborned; stealing a phrase from Scripture, that they
may mock with holy lips; and leaving to the plebeian soldiers
the mutual jest and brutal laugh, that serve to beguile the
hired but hated work of agony, and that draw forth from the
sufferer that burst of forgiving prayer, which sunk at least
into their centurion's heart. One there is, who should have
been spared the hearing of these scoffs; and perhaps she
heard them not; for before his nature was exhausted more,
his eye detects and his voice addresses her, and twines round
her the filial arm of that disciple, who had been ever the most
loving as well as most beloved. She at least lost the religion
of that hour in its humanity, and beheld not the prophet, but
the son:&mdash;had not her own hands wrought that seamless
robe for which the soldiers' lot is cast; and her own lips
taught him that strain of sacred poetry, "My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?" but never had she thought to
hear it <i>thus</i>. As the cries become fainter and fainter, scarcely
do they reach Peter standing afar off. The last notice of him
had been the rebuking look that sent him to weep bitterly;
and now the voice that alone can tell him his forgiveness will
soon be gone! Broken hardly less, though without remorse,
is the youthful John, to see that head, lately resting on his
bosom, drooping passively in death; and to hear the involuntary
shriek of Mary, as the spear struck upon the lifeless
body, moving now only as it is moved;&mdash;whence he alone, on
whom she leaned, records the fact. Well might the Galilean
friends stand at a distance gazing; unable to depart, yet not
daring to approach; well might the multitudes that had cried
"Crucify him!" in the morning, shudder at the thought of that
clamor ere night; "beholding the things that had come to
pass, they smote their breasts and returned."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the scene of which we have to seek the interpretation.
Our first natural impression is, that it requires no interpretation,
but speaks for itself; that it has no mystery,
except that which belongs to the triumphs of deep guilt, and
the sanctities of disinterested love. To raise our eye to that
serene countenance, to listen to that submissive voice, to
note the subjects of its utterance, would give us no idea of
any mystic horror concealed behind the human features of
the scene; of any invisible contortions, as from the lash of
demons, in the soul of that holy victim; of any sympathetic
connection of that cross with the bottomless pit on the one
hand, and the highest heaven on the other; of any moral
revolution throughout our portion of the universe, of which
this public execution is but the outward signal. The historians
drop no hint that its sufferings, its affections, its relations,
were other than human,&mdash;raised indeed to distinction
by miraculous accompaniments; but intrinsically, however
signally, human. They mention, as if bearing some appreciable
proportion to the whole series of incidents, particulars
so slight, as to vanish before any other than the obvious historical
view of the transaction; the thirst, the sponge, the
rent clothes, the mingled drink. They ascribe no sentiment
to the crucified, except such as might be expressed by one
of like nature with ourselves, in the consciousness of a finished
work of duty, and a fidelity never broken under the
strain of heaviest trial. The narrative is clearly the production
of minds filled, not with theological anticipations, but
with historical recollections.</p>

<p>With this view of Christ's death, which is such as might
be entertained by any of the primitive churches, having one
of the Gospels only, without any of the Epistles, we are
content. I conceive of it, then, as manifesting the last degree
of moral perfection in the Holy One of God; and believe
that, in thus being an expression of character, it has its primary
and everlasting value. I conceive of it as the needful
preliminary to his resurrection and ascension, by which the
severest difficulties in the theory of Providence, life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
duty are alleviated or solved. I conceive of it as immediately
procuring the universality and spirituality of the
Gospel; by dissolving those corporeal ties which gave nationality
to Jesus, and making him, in his heavenly and immortal
form, the Messiah of humanity; blessing, sanctifying, regenerating,
not a people from the centre of Jerusalem, but a
world from his station in the heavens. And these views,
under unimportant modifications, I submit, are the only ones
of which Scripture contains a trace.</p>

<p>All this, however, we are assured, is the mere outside
aspect of the crucifixion; and wholly insignificant compared
with the invisible character and relations of the scene;
which, localized only on earth, has its chief effect in hell;
and, though presenting itself among the occurrences of time,
is a repeal of the decretals of Eternity. The being who
hangs upon that cross is not man alone; but also the everlasting
God, who created and upholds all things, even the sun
that now darkens its face upon him, and the murderers who
are waiting for his expiring cry. The anguish he endures is
not chiefly that which falls so poignantly on the eye and ear
of the spectator; the injured human affections, the dreadful
momentary doubt; the pulses of physical torture, doubling
on him with full or broken wave, till driven back by the
overwhelming power of love disinterested and divine. But
he is judicially abandoned by the Infinite Father; who expends
on him the immeasurable wrath due to an apostate
race, gathers up into an hour the lightnings of Eternity, and
lets them loose upon that bended head. It is the moment of
retributive justice; the expiation of all human guilt: that
open brow hides beneath it the despair of millions of men;
and to the intensity of agony there, no human wail could give
expression. Meanwhile, the future brightens on the elect; the
tempests that hung over their horizon are spent. The vengeance
of the lawgiver having had its way, the sunshine of a
Father's grace breaks forth, and lights up, with hope and
beauty, the earth, which had been a desert of despair and
sin. According to this theory, Christ, in his death, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
proper expiatory sacrifice; he turned aside, by enduring it
for them, the infinite punishment of sin from all past or
future believers in this efficacy of the cross; and transferred
to them the natural rewards of his own righteousness.
An acceptance of this doctrine is declared to be the
prime condition of the Divine forgiveness; for no one who
does not <i>see</i> the pardon can <i>have</i> it. And this pardon, again,
this clear score for the past, is a necessary preliminary to all
sanctification; to all practical opening of a disinterested heart
towards our Creator and man. Pardon, and the perception
of it, are the needful preludes to that conforming love to God
and men, which is the true Christian salvation.</p>

<p>The evidence in support of this theory is derived partly
from natural appearances, partly from Scriptural announcements.
Involving, as it does, statements respecting the actual
condition of human nature, and the world in which we
live, some appeal to experience, and to the rational interpretation
of life and Providence, is inevitable; and hence certain
propositions, affecting to be of a philosophical character,
are laid down as fundamental by the advocates of this system.
Yet it is admitted, that direct revelation only could have acquainted
us, either with our lost condition, or our vicarious
recovery; and that all we can expect to accomplish with
nature, is to harmonize what we observe there with what we
read in the written records of God's will; so that the main
stress of the argument rests on the interpretation of Scripture.
The principles deduced from the nature of things, and
laid down as a basis for this doctrine, may be thus represented:&mdash;</p>

<p>That man needs a Redeemer; having obviously fallen, by
some disaster, into a state of misery and guilt, from which
the worst penal consequences must be apprehended; and were
it not for the probability of such lapse from the condition in
which it was fashioned, it would be impossible to reconcile
the phenomena of the world with the justice and benevolence
of its Creator.</p>

<p>That Deity only can redeem; since, to preserve veracity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the penalty of sin must be inflicted; and the diversion only,
not the annihilation of it, is possible. To let it fall on angels
would fail of the desired end; because human sin, having
been directed against an Infinite Being, has incurred an infinitude
of punishment; which on no created beings could
be exhausted in any period short of eternity. Only a nature
strictly infinite can compress within itself, in the compass of
an hour, the woes distributed over the immortality of mankind.
Hence, were God personally One, like man, no redemption
could be effected; for there would be no Deity to
suffer, except the very One who must punish. But the triplicity
of the Godhead relieves all difficulty; for, while one
Infinite inflicts, another Infinite endures; and resources are
furnished for the atonement.</p>

<p>Amid a great variety of forms in which the theory of atonement
exists, I have selected the foregoing; which, if I understand
aright, is that which is vindicated in the present
controversy. I am not aware that I have added anything to
the language in which it is stated by its powerful advocate,
unless it be a few phrases, leaving its essential meaning the
same, but needful to render it compact and clear.</p>

<p>The Scriptural evidence is found principally in certain of
the Apostolical Epistles; and this circumstance will render it
necessary to conduct a separate search into the historical
writings of the New Testament, that we may ascertain how
they express the corresponding set of ideas. Taking up successively
these two branches of the subject, the natural and
the Biblical, I propose to show, first, that this doctrine is inconsistent
with itself; secondly, that it is inconsistent with the
Christian idea of salvation.</p>

<p>I. It is inconsistent with itself.</p>

<p>(1.) In its manner of treating the principles of natural
religion.</p>

<p>Our faith in the infinite benevolence of God is represented
as destitute of adequate support from the testimony of nature.
It requires, we are assured, the suppression of a mass
of appearances, that would scare it away in an instant, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
it to venture into their presence; and is a dream of sickly
and effeminate minds, whose belief is the inward growth
of amiable sentimentality, rather than a genuine production
from God's own facts. The appeal to the order and magnificence
of creation, to the structures and relations of the
inorganic, the vegetable, the animal, the spiritual forms, that
fill the ascending ranks of this visible and conscious universe;&mdash;to
the arrangements which make it a blessing to be born,
far more than a suffering to die,&mdash;which enable us to extract
the relish of life from its toils, the affections of our nature
from its sufferings, the triumphs of goodness from its temptations;&mdash;to
the seeming plan of general progress, which
elicits truth by the self-destruction of error, and by the extinction
of generations gives perpetual rejuvenescence to the
world;&mdash;this appeal, which is another name for the scheme of
natural religion, is dismissed with scorn; and sin and sorrow
and death are flung in defiance across our path,&mdash;barriers
which we must remove, ere we can reach the presence of a
benignant God. Come with us, it is said, and listen to the
wail of the sick infant; look into the dingy haunts where
poverty moans its life away; bend down your ear to the accursed
hum that strays from the busy hives of guilt; spy
into the hold of the slave-ship; from the factory follow the
wasted child to the gin-shop first, and then to the cellar
called its home; or look even at your own tempted and sin-bound
souls, and your own perishing race, snatched off into
the dark by handfuls through the activity of a destroying
God; and tell us, did our benevolent Creator make a creature
and a world like this? A Calvinist who puts this question
is playing with fire. But I answer the question explicitly:
All these things we have met steadily, and face to
face; in full view of them, we have taken up our faith in the
goodness of God; and in full view of them we will hold fast
that faith. Nor is it just or true to affirm, that our system
hides these evils, or that our practice refuses to grapple with
them. And if you confess that these ills of life would be too
much for your natural piety, if you declare, that these rugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
foundations and tempestuous elements of Providence would
starve and crush your confidence in God, while ours strikes
its roots in the rock, and throws out its branches to brave
the storm, are you entitled to taunt us with a faith of puny
growth? Meanwhile, we willingly assent to the principle
which this appeal to evil is designed to establish; that,
with much apparent order, there is some apparent disorder
in the phenomena of the world; that from the latter, by
itself, we should be unable to infer any goodness and benevolence
in God; and that, were not the former clearly the
predominant result of natural laws, the character of the Great
Cause of all things would be involved in agonizing gloom.
The mass of physical and moral evil we do not profess
fully to explain; we think that in no system whatever is
there any approach to an explanation; and we are accustomed
to touch on that dread subject with the humility of
filial trust, not with the confidence of dogmatic elucidation.</p>

<p>Surely the fall of our first parents, I shall be reminded,
gives the requisite solution. The disaster which then befell
the human race has changed the primeval constitution of
things; introduced mortality and all the infirmities of which
it is the result; introduced sin, and all the seeds of vile affections
which it compels us to inherit; introduced also the
penalties of sin, visible in part on this scene of life, and developing
themselves in another in anguish everlasting. Fresh
from the hand of his Creator, man was innocent, happy, and
holy; and he it is, not God, who has deformed the world
with guilt and grief.</p>

<p>Now, <i>as a statement of fact</i>, all this may or may not be
true. Of this I say nothing. But who does not see that, <i>as
an explanation</i>, it is inconsistent with itself, partial in its
application, and leaves matters incomparably worse than it
found them? It is inconsistent with itself; for Adam, perfectly
pure and holy as he is reputed to have been, gave the
only proof that could exist of his being neither, by succumbing
to the first temptation that came in his way; and though
finding no enjoyment but in the contemplation of God, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
himself up to the first advances of the Devil. Never surely
was a reputation for sanctity so cheaply won. The canonizations
of the Romish Calendar have been curiously bestowed
on beings sufficiently remote from just ideas of excellence;
but usually there is <i>something</i> to be affirmed of them, legendary
or otherwise, which, <i>if true</i>, might justify a momentary
admiration. But our first parent was not laid even under this
necessity, to obtain a glory greater than canonization; he had
simply to do nothing, except to fall, in order to be esteemed
the most perfectly holy of created minds. Most partial, too,
is this theory in its application; for disease and hardship, and
death unmerited as the infant's, afflict the lower animal creation.
Is this, too, the result of the fall? If so, it is an <i>unredeemed</i>
effect; if not, it presses on the benevolence of the
Maker, and, by the physical analogies which connect man
with the inferior creatures, forces on us the impression, that
his corporeal sufferings have an original source not dissimilar
from theirs. And again, this explanation only serves to make
matters worse than before. For how puerile is it to suppose
that men will rest satisfied with tracing back their ills to
Adam, and refrain from asking who was Adam's cause! And
then comes upon us at once the ancient dilemma about evil;
was it a mistake, or was it malignity, that created so poor a
creature as our progenitor, and staked on so precarious a will
the blessedness of a race and the well-being of a world? So
far, this theory, falsely and injuriously ascribed to Christianity,
would leave us where we were: but it carries us into deeper
and gratuitous difficulties, of which natural religion knows
nothing, by appending eternal consequences to Adam's transgression;
a large portion of which, after the most sanguine
extension of the efficacy of the atonement, must remain unredeemed.
So that if, under the eye of naturalism, the world,
with its generations dropping into the grave, must appear (as
we heard it recently described<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>) like the populous precincts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of some castle, whose governor called his servants, after a
brief indulgence of liberty and peace, into a dark and inscrutable
dungeon, never to return or be seen again, the only
new feature which this theory introduces into the prospect is
this: that the interior of that cavernous prison-house is disclosed;
and while a few of the departed are seen to have
emerged into a fairer light, and to be traversing greener fields,
and sharing a more blessed liberty than they knew before, the
vast multitude are discerned in the gripe of everlasting chains
and the twist of unimaginable torture. And all this infliction
is a penal consequence of a first ancestor's transgression!
Singular spectacle to be offered in vindication of the character
of God!</p>

<p>We are warned, however, not to start back from this representation,
or to indulge in any rash expression at the view
which it gives of the justice of the Most High; for that,
beyond all doubt, parallel instances occur in the operations
of nature; and that, if the system deduced from Scripture
accords with that which is in action in the creation, there
arises a strong presumption that both are from the same
Author. The arrangement which is the prime subject of objection
in the foregoing theory, viz. the vicarious transmission
of consequences from acts of vice and virtue, is said to be
familiar to our observation as a <i>fact</i>; and ought, therefore, to
present no difficulties in the way of the admission of a <i>doctrine</i>.
Is it not obvious, for example, that the guilt of a
parent may entail disease and premature death on his child,
or even remoter descendants? And if it be consistent with
the Divine perfections that the innocent should suffer for
others' sins at the distance of one generation, why not at the
distance of a thousand? The guiltless victim is not more
completely severed from identity with Adam, than he is from
identity with his own father. My reply is brief: I admit
both the fact and the analogy; but the fact is of the exceptional
kind, from which, by itself, I could not infer the justice
or the benevolence of the Creator; and which, were it of
large and prevalent amount, I could not even reconcile with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
these perfections. If then you take it out of the list of exceptions
and difficulties, and erect it into a cardinal rule, if
you interpret by it the whole invisible portion of God's government,
you turn the scale at once against the character of
the Supreme, and plant creation under a tyrant's sway. And
this is the fatal principle pervading all analogical arguments
in defence of Trinitarian Christianity. No resemblances to
the system can be found in the universe, except in those
anomalies and seeming deformities which perplex the student
of Providence, and which would undermine his faith, were
they not lost in the vast spectacle of beauty and of good.
These disorders are selected and spread out to view, as specimens
of the Divine government of nature; the mysteries and
horrors which offend us in the popular theology are extended
by their side; the comparison is made, point by point, till the
similitude is undeniably made out; and when the argument is
closed it amounts to this: Do you doubt whether God could
break men's limbs? You mistake his strength of character;
only see how he puts out their eyes! What kind of impression
this reasoning may have, seems to me doubtful even to
agony. Both Trinitarian theology and nature, it is triumphantly
urged, must proceed from the same Author; ay, but
what sort of author is that? You have led me, in your quest
after analogies, through the great infirmary of God's creation;
and so haunted am I by the sights and sounds of the lazar-house,
that scarce can I believe in anything but pestilence; so
sick of soul have I become, that the mountain breeze has lost
its scent of health; and you say, it is all the same in the
other world, and wherever the same rule extends: then I
know my fate, that in this universe Justice has no throne.
And thus, my friends, it comes to pass, that these reasoners
often gain indeed their victory; but it is known only to the
Searcher of Hearts, whether it is a victory against natural
religion, or in favor of revealed. For this reason I consider
the "Analogy" of Bishop Butler (one of the profoundest of
thinkers, and on purely moral subjects one of the justest too)
as containing, with a design directly contrary, the most terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
persuasives to Atheism that have ever been produced. The
essential error consists in selecting the difficulties,&mdash;which
are the rare, exceptional phenomena of nature,&mdash;as the basis
of analogy and argument. In the comprehensive and generous
study of Providence, the mind may, indeed, already have
overcome the difficulties, and, with the lights recently gained
from the harmony, design, and order of creation, have made
those shadows pass imperceptibly away; but when forced
again into their very centre, compelled to adopt them as a
fixed station and point of mental vision, they deepen round
the heart again, and, instead of illustrating anything, become
solid darkness themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot quit this topic without observing, however, that
there appears to be nothing in nature and life at all analogous
to the vicarious principle attributed to God in the
Trinitarian scheme of Redemption. There is nowhere to be
found any proper transfer or exchange, either of the qualities,
or of the consequences, of vice and virtue. The good and
evil acts of men do indeed affect others <i>as well</i> as themselves;
the innocent suffer <i>with</i> the guilty, as in the case before adduced,
of a child suffering in health by the excesses of a
parent. But there is here no endurance <i>for</i> another, similar
to Christ's alleged endurance in the place of men; the infliction
on the child is not deducted from the parent; it does
nothing to lighten his load, or make it less than it would
have been, had he been without descendants; nor does any
one suppose his guilt alleviated by the existence of this innocent
fellow-sufferer. There is a nearer approach to analogy
in those cases of crime, where the perpetrator seems to
escape, and to leave the consequences of his act to descend
on others; as when the successful cheat eludes pursuit, and
from the stolen gains of neighbors constructs a life of luxury
for himself; or when a spendthrift government, forgetful of
its high trust, turning the professions of patriotism into a
lie, is permitted to run a prosperous career for one generation,
and is personally gone before the popular retribution
falls, in the next, on innocent successors. Here, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the harmless suffer <i>by</i> the guilty, in a certain sense <i>in the
place of</i> the guilty: but not in the sense which the analogy
requires. For there is still no substitution; the distress of
the unoffending party is not struck out of the offender's punishment;
does not lessen, but rather aggravates, his guilt;
and, instead of fitting him for pardon, tempts the natural
sentiments of justice to follow him with severer condemnation.
Nor does the scheme receive any better illustration
from the fact, that whoever attempts the cure of misery must
himself suffer; must have the shadows of ill cast upon his
spirit from every sadness he alleviates; and interpose himself
to stay the plague which, in a world diseased, threatens to
pass to the living from the dead. The parallel fails, because
there is still no transference: the appropriate sufferings of
sin are not given to the philanthropist; and the noble pains
of goodness in him, the glorious strife of his self-sacrifice,
are no part of the penal consequences of others' guilt; they
do not cancel one iota of those consequences, or make the
crimes which have demanded them, in any way, more ready
for forgiveness. Indeed, it is not in the good man's <i>sufferings</i>,
considered as such, that any efficacy resides; but in
his <i>efforts</i>, which may be made with great sacrifice or without
it, as the case may be. Nor, at best, is there any proper
annihilation of consequences at all accruing from his toils; the
past acts of wrong which call up his resisting energies are
irrevocable, the guilt incurred, the penalty indestructible;
the series of effects, foreign to the mind of the perpetrator,
may be abbreviated; prevention applied to new ills which
threaten to arise; but by all this the personal fitness of the
delinquent for forgiveness is wholly unaffected; the volition
of sin has gone forth, and on it flies, as surely as sound
on a vibration of the air, the verdict of judgment.</p>

<p>Those who are affected by slight and failing analogies
like these, would do well to consider one, sufficiently obvious,
which seems to throw doubt upon their scheme. The atonement
is thought to be, in respect to all believers, a reversal
of the fall: the effects of the fall are partly visible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
temporal, partly invisible and eternal; linked, however, together
as inseparable portions of the same penal system.
Now it is evident, that the supposed redemption on the cross
has left precisely where they were all the <i>visible</i> effects of
the first transgression: sorrow and toil are the lot of all, as
they have been from of old; the baptized infant utters a cry
as sad as the unbaptized; and between the holiness of the
true believer and the worth of the devout heretic, there is
not discernible such a difference as there must have been
between Adam pure and perfect and Adam lapsed and lost.
And is it presumptuous to reason from the seen to the unseen,
from the part which we experience to that which we can only
conceive? If the known effects are unredeemed, the suspicion
is not unnatural, that so are the unknown.</p>

<p>I sum up, then, this part of my subject by observing, that,
besides many inconclusive appeals to nature, the advocates of
the vicarious scheme are chargeable with this fundamental
inconsistency. They appear to deny that the justice and
benevolence of God can be reconciled with the phenomena
of nature; and say that the evidence must be helped out by
resort to their interpretation of Scripture. When, having
heard this auxiliary system, we protest that it renders the
case sadder than before, they assure us that it is all benevolent
and just, because it has its parallel in creation. They
renounce and adopt, in the same breath, the religious appeal
to the universe of God.</p>

<p>(2.) Another inconsistency appears, in the view which this
theory gives of the character of God.</p>

<p>It is assumed that, at the era of creation, the Maker of
mankind had announced the infinite penalties which must
follow the violation of his law; and that their amount did
not exceed the measure which his abhorrence of wrong required.
"And that which he saith, he would not be God if
he did not perform: that which he perceived right, he would
be unworthy of our trust, did he not fulfil. His veracity
and justice, therefore, were pledged to adhere to the word that
had gone forth; and excluded the possibility of any free and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
unconditional forgiveness." Now I would note, in passing,
that this announcement to Adam of an eternal punishment
impending over his first sin, is simply a fiction; for the warning
to him is stated thus: "In the day that thou eatest thereof,
thou shalt surely die"; from which our progenitor must have
been ingenious as a theologian, to extract the idea of endless
life in hell. But to say no more of this, what notions of veracity
have we here? When a sentence is proclaimed against
crime, is it indifferent to judicial truth <i>upon whom</i> it falls?
Personally addressed to the guilty, may it descend without a
lie upon the guiltless? Provided there is the suffering, is it
no matter <i>where</i>? Is this the sense in which God is no respecter
of persons? O what deplorable reflection of human
artifice is this, that Heaven is too veracious to abandon its
proclamation of menace against transgressors, yet is content
to vent it on goodness the most perfect! No darker deed can
be imagined, than is thus ascribed to the Source of all perfection,
under the insulted names of truth and holiness. What
reliance could we have on the faithfulness of such a Being?
If it be consistent with his nature to <i>punish</i> by substitution,
what security is there that he will not <i>reward</i> vicariously?
All must be loose and unsettled, the sentiments of reverence
confused, the perceptions of conscience indistinct, where the
terms expressive of those great moral qualities which render
God himself most venerable are thus sported with and
profaned.</p>

<p>The same extraordinary departure from all intelligible
meaning of words is apparent, when our charge of vindictiveness
against the doctrine of sacrifice is repelled as a slander.
If the rigorous refusal of pardon till the whole penalty has
been inflicted, (when, indeed, it is no pardon at all,) be not
vindictive, we may ask to be furnished with some better
definition. And though it is said, that God's love was manifested
to us by the gift of his Son, this does but change the
object on which this quality is exercised, without removing
the quality itself; putting <i>us</i> indeed into the sunshine of his
grace, but <i>the Saviour</i> into the tempest of his wrath. Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
we desire to sketch the most dreadful form of character, what
more emphatic combination could we invent than this,&mdash;rigor
in the exaction of penal suffering, and indifference as to the
person on whom it falls?</p>

<p>But in truth this system, in its delineations of the Great
Ruler of creation, bids defiance to all the analogies by which
Christ and the Christian heart have delighted to illustrate
his nature. A God who could accept the spontaneously returning
sinner, and restore him by corrective discipline, is pronounced
not worth serving, and an object of contempt.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> If
so, Jesus sketched an object of contempt when he drew the
father of the prodigal son, opening his arms to the poor
penitent, and needing only the sight of his misery to fall on
his neck with the kiss of welcome home. Let the assertions
be true, that sacrifice and satisfaction are needful preliminaries
to pardon, that to pay any attention to repentance without
these is mere weakness, and that it is a perilous deception to
teach the doctrine of mercy apart from the atonement, and
this parable of our Saviour's becomes the most pernicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
instrument of delusion,&mdash;a statement, absolute and unqualified,
of a feeble and sentimental heresy. Who does not see what
follows from this scornful exclusion of corrective punishment?
Suppose the infliction not to be corrective, that is, not to be
designed for any good, what then remains as the cause of the
Divine retribution? The sense of insult offered to a law.
And thus we are virtually told, that God must be regarded
with a mixture of contempt, unless he be susceptible of personal
affront.</p>

<p>(3.) The last inconsistency with itself, which I shall point
out in this doctrine, will be found in the view which it gives
of the work of Christ. Sin, we are assured, is necessarily
infinite. Its infinitude arises from its reference to an Infinite
Being, and involves as a consequence the necessity of redemption
by Deity himself.</p>

<p>The position, that guilt is to be estimated, not by its
amount or its motive, but by the dignity of the being against
whom it is directed, is illustrated by the case of an insubordinate
soldier, whose punishment is increased according as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
his rebellion assails an equal or any of the many grades
amongst his superiors. It is evident, however, that it is not
the dignity of the person, but the magnitude of the effect,
which determines the severity of the sanction by which, in
such an instance, law enforces order. Insult to a monarch is
more sternly treated than injury to a subject, because it incurs
the risk of wider and more disastrous consequences, and
superadds to the personal injury a peril to an official power
which, not resting on individual superiority, but on conventional
arrangement, is always precarious. It is not indeed
easy to form a distinct notion of an infinite act in a finite
agent; and still less is it easy to evade the inference, that, if
an immoral deed against God be an infinite demerit, a moral
deed towards him must be an infinite merit.</p>

<p>Passing by an assertion so unmeaning, and conceding it
for the sake of progress in our argument, I would inquire
what is intended by that other statement, that only Deity
can redeem, and that by Deity the sacrifice was made? The
union of the divine and human natures in Christ is said to
have made his sufferings meritorious in an infinite degree.
Yet we are repeatedly assured, that it was in his manhood
only that he endured and died. If the divine nature in our
Lord had a joint consciousness with the human, then did
God suffer and perish; if not, then did the man only die,
Deity being no more affected by his anguish, than by
that of the malefactors on either side. In the one case the
perfections of God, in the other the reality of the atonement,
must be relinquished. No doubt, the popular belief is, that
the Creator literally expired; the hymns in common use declare
it; the language of pulpits sanctions it; the consistency
of creeds requires it; but professed theologians repudiate the
idea with indignation. Yet by silence or ambiguous speech,
they encourage, in those whom they are bound to enlighten,
this degrading humanization of Deity; which renders it impossible
for common minds to avoid ascribing to him emotions
and infirmities totally irreconcilable with the serene
perfections of the Universal Mind. In his influence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
worshipper, <i>He</i> is no Spirit, who can be invoked by his agony
and bloody sweat, his cross and passion. And the piety
that is thus taught to bring its incense, however sincere, before
the mental image of a being with convulsed features and
expiring cry, has little left of that which makes Christian
devotion characteristically venerable.</p>

<p>II. I proceed to notice the inconsistency of the doctrine
under review with the Christian idea of salvation.</p>

<p>There is one <i>significant Scriptural fact</i>, which suggests to
us the best mode of treating this part of our subject. It is
this: that the language supposed to teach the atoning efficacy
of the cross does not appear in the New Testament till the
Gentile controversy commences, nor ever occurs apart from
the treatment of that subject, under some of its relations.
The cause of this phenomenon will presently appear; meanwhile
I state it, in the place of an assertion sometimes incorrectly
made, viz. that the phraseology in question is confined
to the Epistles. Even this mechanical limitation of sacrificial
passages is indeed nearly true, as not above three or four have
strayed beyond the epistolary boundary into the Gospels and
the book of Acts; but the restriction in respect of subject,
which I have stated, will be found, I believe, to be absolutely
exact, and to furnish the real interpretation to the whole
system of language.</p>

<p>(1.) Let us then first test the vicarious scheme by reference
to the sentiments of Scripture generally, and of our Lord
and his Apostles especially, where this controversy is out of
the way. Are their ideas respecting human character, the
forgiveness of sin, the terms of everlasting life, accordant
with the cardinal notions of a believer in the atonement?
Do they, or do they not, insist on the necessity of a sacrifice
for human sin, as a preliminary to pardon, to sanctification,
to the love of God? Do they, or do they not,
direct a marked and almost exclusive attention to the
cross, as the object to which, far more than to the life and
resurrection of our Lord, all faithful eyes should be directed?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>(a.) Now to the fundamental assertion of the vicarious
system, that the Deity cannot, without inconsistency and imperfection,
pardon on simple repentance, the whole tenor of
the Bible is one protracted and unequivocal contradiction.
So copious is its testimony on this head, that if the passages
containing it were removed, scarcely a shred of Scripture relating
to the subject would remain. "Pardon, I beseech
thee," said Moses, pleading for the Israelites, "the iniquity
of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, and
as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until
now. And the Lord said, <i>I have pardoned according to thy
word</i>." Will it be affirmed, that this chosen people had their
eyes perpetually fixed in faith on the great propitiation, which
was to close their dispensation, and of which their own ceremonial
was a type?&mdash;that whenever penitence and pardon
are named amongst them, this reference is implied, and that
as this faith was called to mind and expressed in the shedding
of blood at the altar, such sacrificial offerings take the place,
in Judaism, of the atoning trust in Christianity? Well, then,
let us quit the chosen nation altogether, and go to a heathen
people, who were aliens to their laws, their blood, their hopes,
and their religion; to whom no sacrifice was appointed, and
no Messiah promised. If we can discover the dealings of
God with such a people, the case, I presume, must be deemed
conclusive. Hear, then, what happened on the banks of the
Tigris. "Jonah began to enter into the city," (Nineveh,)
"and he cried and said, yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed God, and
proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of
them even unto the least of them." "Who can tell," (said
the decree of the king ordaining the fast,) "if God will turn
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we
perish not? And God saw their works, that they turned
from their evil way; and God repented of the evil that he
had said he would do unto them; and he did it not." And
when the prophet was offended, first at this clemency to
Nineveh, and afterwards that the canker was sent to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
his own favorite plant, beneath whose shadow he sat, what
did Jehovah say? "Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for
which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which
came up in a night and perished in a night; and should not
I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore
thousand persons that cannot discern between their
right hand and their left hand?"&mdash;and who are not likely,
one would think, to have discerned the future merits of the
Redeemer.</p>

<p>In truth, if even the Israelites had any such prospective
views to Calvary, if their sacrifices conveyed the idea of the
cross erected there, and were established for this purpose, the
fact must have been privately revealed to modern theologians;
for not a trace of it can be found in the Hebrew writings. It
must be thought strange, that a prophetic reference so habitual
should be always a secret reference; that a faith so fundamental
should be so mysteriously suppressed; that the
uppermost idea of a nation's mind should never have found
its way to lips or pen. "But if it were not so," we are reminded,
"if the Jewish ritual prefigured nothing ulterior, it
was revolting, trifling, savage; its worship a butchery, and
the temple courts no better than a slaughter-house." And
were they not equally so, though the theory of types be true?
If neither priest nor people could <i>see at the time</i> the very
thing which the ceremonial was constructed to reveal, what
advantage is it that divines can see it <i>now</i>? And even if the
notion was conveyed to the Jewish mind, (which the whole
history shows not to have been the fact,) was it necessary
that hecatombs should be slain, age after age, to intimate
obscurely an idea, which one brief sentence might have lucidly
expressed? The idea, however, it is evident, slipped through
after all; for when Messiah actually came, the one great
thing which the Jews did <i>not</i> know and believe about him
was, that he could die at all. So much for the preparatory
discipline of fifteen centuries!</p>

<p>There is no reason, then, why anything should be supplied
in our thoughts, to alter the plain meaning of the announcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of prophets and holy men, of God's unconditional forgiveness
on repentance. "Thou desirest not sacrifice, else
would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt-offering; the
sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." "Wash you,
make you clean," says the prophet Isaiah in the name of the
Lord; "put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve
the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Once
more, "When I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die;
if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he hath
robbed, walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity;
he shall surely live, he shall not die." Nor are the
teachings of the Gospel at all less explicit. Our Lord treats
largely and expressly on the doctrine of forgiveness in several
parables, and especially that of the prodigal son; and omits
all allusion to the propitiation for the past. He furnishes an
express definition of the terms of eternal life: "Good master,
what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
none good save one, that is God; but if thou wilt enter into
life, keep the commandments." And Jesus adds, "If thou
wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come,
follow me." This silence on the prime condition of pardon
cannot be explained by the fact, that the crucifixion had not
yet taken place, and could not safely be alluded to, before the
course of events had brought it into prominent notice. For
we have the preaching of the Apostles, after the ascension,
recorded at great length, and under very various circumstances,
in the book of Acts. We have the very "words
whereby," according to the testimony of an angel, "Cornelius
and all his house shall be saved"; these, one would think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
would be worth hearing in this cause: "God anointed Jesus
of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went
about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
Devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all
things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in
Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree. Him God
raised up the third day, and showed openly; not to all the
people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us,
who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to
testify that it is he who was ordained of God to be the judge
of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness,
that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall
receive remission of sins." Did an Evangelical missionary
dare to preach in this style now, he would be immediately
disowned by his employers, and dismissed as a disguised
Socinian, who kept back all the "peculiar doctrines of the
Gospel."</p>

<p>(b.) The emphatic mention of the resurrection by the
Apostle Peter in this address, is only a particular instance
of a system which pervades the whole preaching of the first
missionaries of Christ. <i>This</i>, and not the cross, with its supposed
effects, is the grand object to which they call the attention
and the faith of their hearers. I cannot quote to you
the whole book of Acts; but every reader knows, that "Jesus
and the resurrection" constitutes the leading theme, the central
combination of ideas in all its discourses. This truth
was shed, from Peter's tongue of fire, on the multitudes that
heard amazed the inspiration of the day of Pentecost. Again,
it was his text, when, passing beneath the beautiful gate, he
made the cripple leap for joy; and then, with the flush of
this deed still fresh upon him, leaned against a pillar in Solomon's
porch, and spake in explanation to the awe-struck
people, thronging in at the hour of prayer. Before priests
and rulers, before Sanhedrim and populace, the same tale is
told again, to the utter exclusion, be it observed, of the
essential doctrine of the cross. The authorities of the temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
we are told, were galled and terrified at the Apostle's preaching;
"naturally enough," it will be said, "since, the real
sacrifice having been offered, their vocation, which was to
make the prefatory and typical oblation, was threatened with
destruction." But no, this is not the reason given: "They
were grieved because they preached, through Jesus, the resurrection
from the dead." Paul, too, while his preaching was
spontaneous and free, and until he had to argue certain controversies
which have long ago become obsolete, manifested a
no less remarkable predilection for this topic. Before Felix,
he declares what was the grand indictment of his countrymen
against him: "Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am
called in question of you this day." Follow him far away
from his own land; and, with foreigners, he harps upon the
same subject, as if he were a man of one idea; which, indeed,
according to our opponents' scheme, he ought to have
been, only it should have been <i>another idea</i>. Seldom, however,
can we meet with a more exuberant mind than Paul's;
yet the resurrection obviously haunts him wherever he goes:
in the synagogue of Antioch you hear him dwelling on it with
all the energy of his inspiration; and, at Athens, it was this
on which the scepticism of Epicureans and Stoics fastened for
a scoff. In his Epistles, too, where he enlarges so much on
justification by faith, when we inquire what precisely is this
faith, and what the object it is to contemplate and embrace,
this remarkable fact presents itself: that the one only important
thing respecting Christ, which is <i>never once</i> mentioned
as the object of justifying faith, is <i>his death</i>, <i>and blood</i>, <i>and
cross</i>. "Faith" by itself, the "faith of Jesus Christ," "faith
of the Gospel," "faith of the Son of God," are expressions
of constant occurrence; and wherever this general description
is replaced by a more specific account of this justifying state
of mind, it is <i>faith in the resurrection</i> on which attention is
fastened. "It is Christ that died, <i>yea, rather, that is risen
again</i>." "He was delivered for our offences, and <i>raised again
for our justification</i>." "Faith shall be imputed to us for
righteousness, if we believe on <i>him that raised up Jesus our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Lord from the dead</i>." Hear, too, the Apostle's definition of
saving faith: "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart <i>that God hath raised him
from the dead</i>, thou shalt be saved." The only instance in
which the writings of St. Paul appear to associate the word
faith with the death of Christ, is the following text: "Whom
God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood"; and in this case the Apostle's meaning would, I conceive,
be more faithfully given by destroying this conjunction,
and disposing the words thus: "Whom God hath set forth to
be a propitiation by his blood, through faith." The idea of his
<i>blood</i>, or <i>death</i>, belongs to the word propitiation, not to the word
faith. To this translation no Trinitarian scholar, I am persuaded,
can object;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and when the true meaning of the writer's
sacrificial language is explained, the distinction will appear to
be not unimportant. At present I am concerned only with
the defence of my position, that the death of Christ is never
mentioned as the object of saving faith; but that his resurrection
unquestionably is. This phenomenon in Scripture
phraseology is so extraordinary, so utterly repugnant to everything
which a hearer of orthodox preaching would expect,
that I hardly expect my affirmation of it to be believed. The
two ideas of <i>faith</i>, and of our <i>Lord's death</i>, are so naturally
and perpetually united in the mind of every believer in the
atonement, that it must appear to him incredible that they
should never fall together in the writings of the Apostles.
However, I have stated my fact; and it is for you to bring it
to the test of Scripture.</p>

<p>(c.) Independently of all written testimony, moral reasons,
we are assured, exist, which render an absolute remission for
the past essential to a regenerated life for the future. Our
human nature is said to be so constituted, that the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of sin, on the conscience once awakened, is intolerable; our
spirit cries aloud for mercy; yet is so straitened by the bands
of sin, so conscious of the sad alliance lingering still, so full
of hesitancy and shame when seeking the relief of prayer, so
blinded by its tears when scanning the heavens for an opening
of light and hope, that there is no freedom, no unrestrained
and happy love to God; but a pinched and anxious mind,
bereft of power, striving to work with bandaged or paralytic
will, instead of trusting itself to loosened and self-oblivious
affections. Hence it is thought, that the sin of the past must
be cancelled, before the holiness of the future can be commenced;
that it is a false order to represent repentance as
leading to pardon, because to be forgiven is the prerequisite
to love. We cannot forget, however, how distinctly and
emphatically he who, after God, best knew what is in
man, has contradicted this sentiment; for when that sinful
woman, whose presence in the house shocked the sanctimonious
Pharisee, stood at his feet as he reclined, washing
them with her tears, and kissing them with reverential
lips, Jesus turned to her and said, "Her sins, which are
many, are forgiven; <i>for</i> she loved much." From him, then,
we learn, what our own hearts would almost teach, that love
may be the prelude to forgiveness, as well as forgiveness the
preparative for love.</p>

<p>At the same time let me acknowledge, that this statement
respecting the moral effects of conscious pardon, to which I
have invoked Jesus to reply, is by no means an unmixed
error. It touches upon a very profound and important truth;
and I can never bring myself to regard that assurance of
Divine forgiveness, which the doctrine of atonement imparts,
as a demoralizing state of mind, encouraging laxity of conscience
and a continuance in sin. The sense of pardon, doubtless,
reaches the secret springs of gratitude, presents the soul
with an object, strange before, of new and divine affection,
and binds the child of redemption, by all generous and filial
obligations, to serve with free and willing heart the God who
hath gone forth to meet him. That the motives of self-interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
are diminished in such a case, is a trifle that need
occasion small anxiety. For the human heart is no laborer
for hire; and, where there is opportunity afforded for true
and noble love, will thrust away the proffered wages, and toil
rather in a free and thankful spirit. If we are to compare,
as a source of duty, the grateful with the merely prudential
temper, rather may we trust the first, as not the worthier
only, but the stronger too; and till we obtain emancipation
from the latter,&mdash;forget the computations of hope and fear,
and precipitate ourselves for better or for worse on some object
of divine love and trust,&mdash;our nature will be puny and weak,
our wills will turn in sickness from their duty, and our affections
shrink in aversion from their heaven. But though personal
gratitude is better than prudence, there is a higher
service still. A more disinterested love may spring from the
contemplation of what God is in himself, than from the recollection
of what he has done for us; and when this mingles
most largely as an element among our springs of action;
when, humbled indeed by a knowledge of dangers that await
us, and thankful, too, for the blessings spread around us, we
yet desire chiefly to be fitting children of the everlasting
Father and the holy God; when we venerate him for the
graciousness, and purity, and majesty of his spirit, impersonated
in Jesus, and resolve to serve him truly, <i>before</i> he
has granted the desire of our heart, and because he is of a
nature so sublime and merciful and good;&mdash;then are we in
the condition of her who bent over the feet of Christ; and
we are forgiven, because we have loved much.</p>

<p>(2.) Let us now, in conclusion, turn our attention to those
portions of the New Testament which speak of the death of
Christ as the means of redemption.</p>

<p>I have said, that these are to be found exclusively in passages
of the sacred writings which treat of the Gentile controversy,
or of topics immediately connected with it. This
controversy arose naturally out of the design of Providence
to make the narrow, exclusive, ceremonial system of Judaism
give birth to the universal and spiritual religion of the Gospel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
from God's method of expanding the Hebrew Messiah
into the Saviour of humanity. For this the nation was not
prepared; to this even the Hebrew Christians could not easily
conform their faith; and in the achievement of this, or in
persuading the world that it was achieved, did Paul spend his
noble life, and write his astonishing Epistles. The Jews knew
that the Deliverer was to be of their peculiar stock, and their
royal lineage; they believed that he would gather upon himself
all the singularities of their race, and be a Hebrew to
intensity; that he would literally restore the kingdom to
Israel; ay, and extend it too, immeasurably beyond the
bounds of its former greatness; till, in fact, it swallowed up
all existing principalities, and powers, and thrones, and dominions,
and became coextensive with the earth. Then in
Jerusalem, as the centre of the vanquished nations, before
the temple, as the altar of a humbled world, did they expect
the Messiah to erect his throne; and when he had taken the
seat of judgment, to summon all the tribes before his tribunal,
and pass on the Gentiles, excepting the few who might submit
to the law, a sentence of perpetual exclusion from his realm;
while his own people would be invited to the seats of honor,
occupy the place of authority, and sit down with him (the
greatest at his right hand and his left) at his table in his
kingdom. The holy men of old were to come on earth again
to see this day. And many thought that every part of the
realm thus constituted, and all its inhabitants, would never
die: but, like the Messiah himself, and the patriarchs whom
he was to call to life, would be invested with immortality.
None were to be admitted to these golden days except themselves;
all else to be left in outer darkness from this region
of light, and there to perish and be seen no more. The grand
title to admission was conformity with the Mosaic law; the
most ritually scrupulous were the most secure; and the careless
Israelite, who forgot or omitted an offering, a tithe, a
Sabbath duty, might incur the penalty of exclusion and death:
the law prescribed such mortal punishment for the smallest
offence; and no one, therefore, could feel himself ready with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
his claim, if he had not yielded a perfect obedience. If God
were to admit him on any other plea, it would be of pure
grace and goodness, and not in fulfilment of any promise.</p>

<p>The Jews, being scattered over the civilized world, and
having synagogues in every city, came into perpetual contact
with other people. Nor was it possible that the Gentiles,
among whom they lived, should notice the singular purity
and simplicity of the Israelitish Theism, without some of them
being struck with its spirit, attracted by its sublime principles,
and disposed to place themselves in religious relations
with that singular people. Having been led into admiration,
and even profession, of the nation's theology, they could not
but desire to share their hopes; which indeed were an integral
part of their religion, and, at the Christian era, the one
element in it to which they were most passionately attached.
But this was a stretch of charity too great for any Hebrew;
or, at all events, if such admission were ever to be thought
of, it must be only on condition of absolute submission to
the requirements of the law. The Gentile would naturally
plead, that, as God had not made him of the chosen nation,
he had given him no law, except that of conscience; that,
being without the law, he must be a law unto himself; and
that, if he had lived according to his light, he could not be
justly excluded on the ground of accidental disqualification.
Possibly, in the provocation of dispute, the Gentile might
sometimes become froward and insolent in his assertion of
claim; and, in the pride of his heart, demand as a right that
which, at most, could only be humbly hoped for as a privilege
and a free gift.</p>

<p>Thus were the parties mutually placed to whom the Deliverer
came. Thus dense and complicated was the web of
prejudice which clung round the early steps of the Gospel;
and which must be burst or disentangled ere the glad tidings
could have free course and be glorified. How did Providence
develop from such elements the divine and everlasting truth?
Not by neglecting them, and speaking to mankind as if they
had no such ideas; not by forbidding his messengers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
teachers to have any patience with them; but, on the contrary,
by using these very notions as temporary means to his
everlasting ends; by touching this and that with light before
the eyes of Apostles, as if to say, there are good capabilities
in these; the truth may be educed from them so gently and
so wisely, that the world will find itself in light, without perceiving
how it has been quitting the darkness.</p>

<p>So long as Christ remained on earth, he necessarily confined
his ministry to his nation. He would not have been
the Messiah had he done otherwise. By birth, by lineage,
by locality, by habit, he was altogether theirs. Whoever,
then, of his own people, during his mortal life, believed in
him and followed him, became a subject of the Messiah;
ready, it was supposed, even by the Apostles themselves, to
enter the glory of his kingdom, whenever it should please
him to assume it; qualified at once, by the combination of
pedigree and of belief, to enter into life, to become a member
of the kingdom of God, to take a place among the elect;
for by all these phrases was described the admission to the
expected realm. If, then, Jesus had never suffered and
died, if he had never retired from this world, but stayed to
fulfil the anticipations of his first followers, his Messianic
kingdom might have included all the converts of the Israelitish
stock. From the exclusion which fell on others, they would
have obtained salvation. Hence, it is never in connection
with the first Jewish Christians that the <i>death of Christ</i> is
mentioned.</p>

<p>It was otherwise, however, with the Gentiles. They could
not become his followers in his mortal lifetime; and had a
Messianic reign <i>then</i> been set up, they must have been excluded;
no missionary would have been justified in addressing
them with invitation; they could not, as it was said, have
entered into life. The Messiah must cease to be Jewish,
before he could become universal; and this implied his death,
by which alone the personal relations, which made him the
property of a nation, could be annihilated. To this he submitted;
he disrobed himself of his corporeality, he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
an immortal spirit; thereby instantly burst his religion open
to the dimensions of the world; and, as he ascended to the
skies, sent it forth to scatter the seeds of blessing over the
field of the world, long ploughed with cares, and moist with
griefs, and softened now to nourish in its bosom the tree of
Life.</p>

<p>Now, how would the effect of this great revolution be described
to the proselyte Gentiles, so long vainly praying for
admission to the Israelitish hope. At once it destroyed their
exclusion; put away as valueless the Jewish claims of circumcision
and law; nailed the handwriting of ordinances to
the cross; reconciled them that had been afar off; redeemed
them to God by his blood, out of every tongue, and kindred,
and people, and nation; washed them in his blood; justified
them <i>by his resurrection and ascension</i>; an expression, I
would remark, unmeaning on any other explanation.</p>

<p>Even during our Lord's personal ministry his approaching
death is mentioned as the means of introducing the Gentiles
into his Messianic kingdom. He adverts repeatedly to
his cross, as designed to widen, by their admission, the extent
of his sway; and, according to Scripture phrase, to yield
to him "much fruit." He was already on his last fatal visit
to Jerusalem, when, taking the hint from <i>the visit of some
Greeks to him</i>, he exclaimed: "The hour is come, that the
Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abideth alone: but <i>if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit</i>."
He adds, in allusion to the death he should die: "And I, if
I be lifted up from the earth, will draw <i>all men unto me</i>."
It is for this end that he resigns for a while his life,&mdash;that he
may bring in the wanderers who are not of the commonwealth
of Israel: "Other sheep I have, which are not of
this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd: <i>therefore
doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life</i>, that
I may take it again." Many a parable did Jesus utter, proclaiming
his Father's intended mercy to the uncovenanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
nations: but for himself personally he declared, "I am not
sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." His
advent was a promise of <i>their</i> economy; his office, the traditionary
hope of their fathers; his birth, his life, his person,
were under the Law, and excluded him from relations to
those who were beyond its obligations. On the cross, all the
connate peculiarities of the Nazarene ceased to exist: when
the seal of the sepulchre gave way, the seal of the law was
broken too; the nationality of his person passed away; for
how can an immortal be a Jew? This, then, was the time to
open wide the scope of his mission, and to invite to God's
acceptance those that fear him in every nation. Though, before,
the disciple might "have known Christ after the flesh,"
and followed his steps as the Hebrew Messiah, "yet now
henceforth was he to know him so no more"; these "old
things had passed away," since he had "died for all,"&mdash;died
to become universal,&mdash;to drop all exclusive relations, and
"reconcile the world," the Gentile world, to God. Observe
to whom this "ministry of reconciliation" is especially confided.
As if to show that it is exclusively <i>the risen Christ</i>
who belongs to all men, and that his death was the instrument
of the Gentiles' admission, their great Apostle was one Paul,
who had not known the Saviour in his mortal life; who never
listened to his voice till it spake from heaven; who himself
was the convert of his ascension; and bore to him the relation,
not of subject to the person of a Hebrew king, but of
spirit to spirit, unembarrassed by anything earthly, legal, or
historical. Well did Paul understand the freedom and the
sanctity of this relation; and around the idea of the Heavenly
Messiah gathered all his conceptions of the spirituality of the
Gospel, of its power over the unconscious affections, rather
than a reluctant will. His believing countrymen were afraid
to disregard the observances of the law, lest it should be a
disloyalty to God, and disqualify them for the Messiah's
welcome, when he came to take his power and reign. Paul
tells them, that, while their Lord remained in this mortal
state, they were right; as representative of the law, and filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
an office created by the religion of Judaism, he could not but
have held them <i>then</i> to its obligations; nor could they, without
infidelity, have neglected its claims, any more than a wife can
innocently separate herself from a living husband. But as
the death of the man sets the woman free, and makes null the
law of their union, so the decease of Christ's body emancipates
his followers from all legal relations to him; and they
are at liberty to wed themselves anew to the risen Christ,
who dwells where no ordinance is needful, no tie permitted
but of the spirit, and all are as the angels of God. Surely,
then, this mode of conception explains why the death of Jesus
constitutes a great date in the Christian economy, especially
as expounded by the friend and Apostle of those who were
not "Jews by nature, but sinners of the Gentiles." Had he
never died, they must have remained aliens from his sway;
the enemies against whom his power must be directed; without
hope in the day of his might; strangers to God and his
vicegerent.</p>

<p>But, while thus they "were yet without strength, Christ
died for" these "ungodly"; died to put himself into connection
with them, else impossible; and, rising from death,
drew them after him into spiritual existence on earth, analogous
to that which he passed in heaven. "You," says their
Apostle, "being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him"; giving
you, as "risen with him," a life above the world and its law
of exclusion,&mdash;a life not "subject to ordinances," but of
secret love and heavenly faith, "hid with Christ in God";
"blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and taking it out of the way,
nailing it to his cross." God had never intended to perpetuate
the division between Israel and the world, receiving
the one as the sons, and shutting out the other as the slaves
of his household. If there had been an appearance of such
partiality, he had always designed to set these bondmen free,
and to make them "heirs of God through Christ"; "in
whom they had redemption through his blood" from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
servile state, the forgiveness of disqualifying sins, according
to the riches of his grace. Though the Hebrews boasted
that "theirs was the adoption," and till Messiah's death
had boasted truly; yet in that event God, "before the foundation
of the world," had "blessed us" (Gentiles) "with all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places"; "having predestinated
us unto the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ, according"
(not indeed to any right or promise, but) "to the
good pleasure of his will," "and when we were enemies,
having reconciled us, by the death of his Son"; "that in the
fulness of times he might gather together in one <i>all things</i> in
Christ"; "by whom we" (Gentiles) "have now received this
atonement" (reconciliation); that he might have no partial
empire, but that "in him might all fulness dwell." "Wherefore,"
says their Apostle, "remember that ye, <i>Gentiles in the
flesh</i>, were in time past without Messiah, being aliens from
the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant
of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world;
but now in Christ Jesus, ye, who sometime were afar off, are
made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who
hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall
of partition between us" (not between God and man, but
between Jew and Gentile); "having abolished in his flesh
the enmity, even the law of commandments, contained in ordinances;
for to make in himself, of twain, one new man, so
<i>making peace</i>; and that he might reconcile both unto God, in
one body, by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby; and
came and preached peace to you who were afar off, as well
as to them that were nigh. For through him we both have
an access by one spirit unto the Father."</p>

<p>The way, then, is clear and intelligible, in which the death
and ascension of the Messiah rendered him universal, by
giving spirituality to his rule; and, on the simple condition of
faith, added the uncovenanted nations to his dominion, so far
as they were willing to receive him. This idea, and this only,
will be found in almost every passage of the New Testament
(excepting the Epistle to the Hebrews) usually adduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to prove the doctrine of the Atonement. Some of the
strongest of these I have already quoted; and my readers
must judge whether they have received a satisfactory meaning.
There are others, in which the Gentiles are not so distinctly
stated to be the sole objects of the redemption of the
cross; but with scarcely an exception, so far as I can discover,
this limitation is implied, and either creeps out through some
adjacent expression in the context, or betrays itself, when we
recur to the general course of the Apostle's argument, or to
the character and circumstances of his correspondents. Thus
Paul says, that Christ "gave himself a ransom for all, to be
testified in due time"; the next verse shows what is in his
mind, when he adds, "<i>whereunto</i> I am ordained a preacher,
and an Apostle, a teacher of <span class="smcap">the Gentiles</span> in faith and
verity"; and the whole sentiment of the context is the <i>Universality
of the Gospel</i>, and the duty of praying for Gentile
kings and people, as not abandoned to a foreign God and
another Mediator; for since Messiah's death, to <i>us all</i> "there
is but One God, and One Mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus": wherefore the Apostle wills, that <i>for
all</i> "men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without
wrath and doubting,"&mdash;without wrath at their admission, or
doubt of their adoption. And wherever emphasis is laid on
the <i>vast number</i> benefited by the cross, a contrast is implied
with the <i>few</i> (only the Jews) who could have been his subjects
had he not died: and when it is said, "he gave his life
a ransom <i>for many</i>"; his blood was "shed <i>for many</i>, for the
remission of sins"; "thou wast slain, and hast redeemed
us by thy blood, <i>out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
and nation</i>, and hast made us unto our God kings and
priests, and we shall reign on the earth"; "behold the
Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of <i>the world</i>";<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
all these expressions is still denoted the efficacy of Christ's
death in removing the Gentile disqualification, and making
his dispensation spiritual as his celestial existence, and universal
as the Fatherhood of God. Does Paul exhort certain
of his disciples "to feed the church of the Lord, which he
hath purchased with his own blood"?<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> We find that he is
speaking of the <i>Gentile</i> church of Ephesus, whose elders he
is instructing in the management of their charge, and to
which he afterwards wrote the well-known Epistle, on their
Gentile freedom and adoption obtained by the Messiah's
death. When Peter says, "Ye know that ye were not redeemed
with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
vain conversation, received by tradition from your fathers;
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot,"&mdash;we must inquire <i>to whom</i> he is
addressing these words. If it be to the Jews, the interpretation
which I have hitherto given of such language will not
apply, and we must seek an explanation altogether different.
But the whole manner of this Epistle, the complexion of its
phraseology throughout, convinces me that it was addressed
especially to the <i>Gentile converts</i> of Asia Minor; and that
the redemption of which it speaks is no other than that
which is the frequent theme of their own Apostle.</p>

<p>In the passage just quoted, the form of expression itself
suggests the idea, that Peter is addressing a class which did
not include himself: "<span class="smcap">Ye</span> were not redeemed," &amp;c.; farther
on, in the same Epistle, the same sentiment occurs, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
without any such visible restriction. Exhorting to patient
suffering for conscience' sake, he appeals to the example of
Christ; "who, when he suffered, threatened not, but committed
himself to Him that judgeth righteously; who, his own
self, bare <i>our</i> sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness": yet,
with instant change in the expression, revealing his correspondents
to us, the Apostle adds, "by whose stripes <span class="smcap">ye</span>
were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are
now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
With the instinct of a gentle and generous heart, the writer,
treating in plain terms of the former sins of those whom he
addresses, puts himself in with them; and avoids every appearance
of that spiritual pride by which the Jew constantly
rendered himself offensive to the Gentile.</p>

<p>Again, in this letter, he recommends the duty of patient
endurance, by appeal to the same consideration of Christ's
disinterested self-sacrifice. "It is better, if the will of God
be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing: for
Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
that he might bring us to God." And who are these "unjust"
that are thus brought to God? The Apostle instantly
explains, by describing how the "Jews by nature" lost possession
of Messiah by the death of his person, and "sinners
of the Gentiles" gained him by the resurrection of his immortal
nature; "being put to death in flesh, but quickened
in spirit; and <i>thereby he went and preached unto the spirits in
prison, who formerly were without faith</i>." This is clearly a
description of the heathen world, ere it was brought into
relation to the Messianic promises. Still further confirmation,
however, follows. The Apostle adds: "Forasmuch, then, as
Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
with the same mind; for the time past of our life may
suffice us to have wrought the will <i>of the Gentiles</i>; when <i>we</i>
walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,
banquetings, and <i>abominable idolatries</i>." If we cannot admit
this to be a just description of the holy Apostle's former life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
we must perceive that, writing to Pagans of whom it was all
true, he beautifully withholds from his language every trace
of invidious distinction, puts himself for the moment into the
same class, and seems to take his share of the distressing
recollection.</p>

<p>The habitual delicacy with which Paul, likewise, classed
himself with every order of persons in turn, to whom he had
anything painful to say, is known to every intelligent reader
of his Epistles. Hence, in <i>his</i> writings too, we have often
to consider <i>with whom</i> it is that he is holding his dialogue, and
to make our interpretation dependent on the answer. When,
for example, he says, that Jesus "was delivered for <i>our</i>
offences, and was raised again for <i>our</i> justification"; I ask,
"For whose?&mdash;was it for everybody's?&mdash;or for the Jews',
since Paul was a Hebrew?" On looking closely into the
argument, I find it beyond doubt that neither of these answers
is correct; and that the Apostle, in conformity with his frequent
practice, is certainly identifying himself, Israelite though
he was, with <i>the Gentiles</i>, to whom, at that moment, his reasoning
applies itself. The neighboring verses have expressions
which clearly enough declare this: "when we were <i>yet
without strength</i>," and "<i>while we were yet sinners</i>," Christ died
for us. It is to the <i>Gentile church</i> at Corinth, and while
expatiating on their privileges and relations as such, that
Paul speaks of the disqualifications and legal unholiness of
the heathen, as vanishing in the death of the Messiah; as the
recovered leper's uncleanness was removed, and his banishment
reversed, and his exclusion from the temple ended,
when the lamb without blemish, which the law prescribed
as his sin-offering, bled beneath the knife, so did God provide
in Jesus a lamb without blemish for the exiled and unsanctified
Gentiles, to bring them from their far dwelling in the
leprous haunts of this world's wilderness, and admit them to
the sanctuary of spiritual health and worship: "He hath
made him to be a sin-offering for us (Gentiles), who knew no
sin; that we might be made the justified of God in him";
entering, under the Messiah, the community of saints. That,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in this sacrificial allusion, the Gentile adoption is still the
Apostle's only theme, is evident hence: that twice in this
very passage he declares that he is speaking of that peculiar
"reconciliation," the word and ministry of which have been
committed to himself; he is dwelling on the topic most natural
to one who "magnified his office," as "Apostle of the Gentiles."</p>

<p>To the same parties was Paul writing, when he said,
"Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us." Frequently as
this sentence is cited in evidence of the doctrine of Atonement,
there is hardly a verse in Scripture more utterly inapplicable;
nor, if the doctrine were true, could anything be
more inept than an allusion to it in this place. I do not
dwell on the fact that the paschal lamb was neither sin-offering
nor proper sacrifice at all: for the elucidation of the
death of Jesus by sacrificial analogies is as easy and welcome
as any other mode of representing it. But I turn to
the whole context, and seek for its leading idea, before multiplying
inferences from a subordinate illustration. I find the
author treating, not of the <i>deliverance</i> of believers from curse
or exclusion, but of their duty to keep the churches cleansed,
by the expulsion of notoriously profligate members. Such
persons they are to cast from them, as the Jews, at the passover,
swept from their houses all the leaven they contained;
and as for eight days, at that season, only pure unleavened
bread was allowed for use, so the Church must keep the
Gospel festival free from the ferment of malice and wickedness,
and tasting nothing but sincerity and truth. This comparison
is the primary sentiment of the whole passage; under
cover of which the Apostle is urging the Corinthians to expel
a certain licentious offender: and only because the feast of
unleavened bread, on which his fancy has alighted, set in with
the day of passover, does he allude to this in completion of
the figure. As his correspondents were Gentiles, their Christianity
commenced with the death of Christ; with him, as an
immortal, their spiritual relations commenced; when he rose,
they rose with him, as by a divine attraction, from an earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to a heavenly state; their old and corrupt man had been
buried together with him, and, with the human infirmities of
his person, left behind for ever in his sepulchre; and it became
them "to seek those things which are above," and to
"yield themselves to God, as those that are alive from the
dead." This period of the Lord's sequestration in the heavens
Paul represents as a festival of purity to the disciples on
earth, ushered in by the self-sacrifice of Christ. The time is
come, he says; cast away the leaven, for the passover is slain,
blessed bread of heaven to them that taste it! let nothing
now be seen in all the household of the Church, but the unleavened
cake of simplicity and love.</p>

<p>Paul again appears as the advocate of the Gentiles, when
he protests that now between them and the Jews "there is
no difference, since all have sinned and come short of the
glory of God"; that the Hebrew has lost all claim to the
Messianic adoption, and can have no hope but in that free
grace of God, which has a sovereign right to embrace the
heathen too; and which, in fact, has compassed the Gentiles
within its redemption, by causing Jesus the Messiah to die;
"by whose blood God hath set forth a propitiation, through
faith; to evince his justice, while overlooking, with the forbearance
of God, transgressions past;&mdash;to evince his justice
in the arrangements of the present crisis; which preserve his
justice (to the Israelite), yet justify on mere discipleship to
Jesus." The great question which the Apostle discusses
throughout this Epistle is this: "On what terms is a man
now admitted as a subject to the Messiah, so as to be acknowledged
by him, when he comes to erect his kingdom?"
"He must be one of the circumcised, to whom alone the holy
law and promises are given," says the Jew. "That is well,"
replies Paul; "only the promises, you remember, are conditional
on obedience; and he who claims by the law must
stand the judgment of the law. Can your nation abide this
test, and will you stake your hopes upon the issue? Or is
there on record against you a violation of every condition of
your boasted covenant,&mdash;wholesale and national transgression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
which your favorite code itself menaces with 'cutting off'?
Have you even rejected and crucified the very Messiah, who
was tendered to you in due fulfilment of the promises? Take
your trial by the principles of your law, and you must be
cast off, and perish, as certainly as the heathen whom you
despise; and whose rebellion against the natural law, gross
as it is, does not surpass your own offences against the tables
of Moses. You must abandon the claim of right, the high
talk of God's justice and plighted faith;&mdash;which are alike
ill suited to you both. The rules of law are out of the question,
and would admit nobody; and we must ascend again
to the sovereign will and free mercy of Him who is the source
of law; and who, to bestow a blessing which its resources
cannot confer, may devise new methods of beneficence. God
has violated no pledge. Messiah came to Israel, and never
went beyond its bounds; the uncircumcised had no part in
him; and every Hebrew who desired it was received as his
subject. But when the people would not have him, and
threw away their ancient title, was God either to abandon his
vicegerent, or to force him on the unwilling? No: rather
did it befit him to say: 'If they will reject and crucify my
servant,&mdash;why, let him die, and then he is Israelite no more;
I will raise him, and take him apart in his immortality; where
his blood of David is lost; and the holiness of his humanity
is glorified; and all shall be his, who will believe, and love
him, as he there exists, spiritually and truly.'" Thus, according
to Paul, does God provide a new method of adoption
or justification, without violating any promises of the old.
Thus he makes Faith in Jesus&mdash;a moral act, instead of a
genealogical accident&mdash;the single condition of reception into
the Divine kingdom upon earth. Thus, after the passage of
Christ from this world to another, Jew and Gentile are on an
equality in relation to the Messiah; the one gaining nothing
by his past privileges; the other, not visited with exclusion
for past idolatry and sins, but assured, in Messiah's death,
that these are to be overlooked, and treated as if cleansed
away. He finds himself invited into the very penetralia of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that sanctuary of pure faith and hope, from which before he
had been repelled as an unclean thing; as if its ark of mercy
had been purified for ever from his unworthy touch, or he
himself had been sprinkled by some sudden consecration.
And all this was the inevitable and instant effect of that death
on Calvary, which took Messiah from the Jews and gave him
to the world.</p>

<p>With emphasis, not less earnest than that of Paul, does
the Apostle John repudiate the notion of any <i>claim</i> on the
Divine admission by law or righteousness; and insist on
humble and unqualified acceptance of God's free grace and
remission for the past, as the sole avenue of entrance to the
kingdom. This avenue was open, however, to all "who
confessed that Jesus the Messiah had come in the flesh"; in
other words, that, during his mortal life, Jesus had been
indicated as this future Prince; and that his ministry was the
Messiah's preliminary visit to that earth on which shortly he
would reappear to reign. The great object of that visit was
to prepare the world for his real coming; for as yet it was
very unfit for so great a crisis; and especially to open, by his
death, a way of admission for the Gentiles, and frame, on
their behalf, an act of oblivion for the past. "If," says the
Apostle to them, "we walk in the light, <i>as he is in the light</i>"
(of love and heaven), "we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all
sin": the Israelite will embrace the Gentiles in fraternal relations,
knowing that the cross has removed their past unholiness.
Nor let the Hebrew rely on anything now but the
Divine forbearance; to appeal to rights will serve no longer:
"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us." Nor let any one despair of a reception,
or even a restoration, because he has been an idolater and
sinner: "Jesus Christ the righteous" is "an advocate with
the Father" for admitting all who are willing to be his; "and
he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only (not
merely for our small portion of Gentiles, already converted);
but also for the <i>whole</i> world," if they will but accept him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
He died to become universal; to make all his own; to spread
an oblivion, wide as the earth, over all that had embarrassed
the relations to the Messiah, and made men aliens, instead of
Sons of God. Yet did no spontaneous movement of their
good affections solicit this change. It was "not that we
(Gentiles) loved God; but that he loved us, and sent his
Son, the propitiation for our sins"; "he sent his only-begotten
Son into the world, that we might live through him."
That this Epistle was addressed to Gentiles, and is therefore
occupied with the same leading idea respecting the cross
which pervades the writings of Paul, is rendered probable by
its concluding words, which could hardly be appropriate to
Jews: "Keep yourselves from idols." How little the Apostle
associated any vicarious idea even with a form of phrase
most constantly employed by modern theology to express it,
is evident from the parallel which he draws, in the following
words, between the death of our Lord and that of the Christian
martyrs: "Hereby perceive we love, because <i>Christ</i>
laid down his life <i>for us</i>; and we ought to lay down our
lives <i>for the brethren</i>."</p>

<p>Are, then, the <i>Gentiles alone</i> beneficially affected by the
death of Christ? and is no wider efficacy <i>ever</i> assigned to it
in Scripture? The great number of passages to which I have
already applied this single interpretation will show that I
consider it as comprising <i>the great leading idea</i> of the Apostolic
theology on this subject; nor do I think that there is
(out of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which I shall soon notice)
a single doctrinal allusion to the cross, from which this
conception is wholly absent. At the same time, I am not
prepared to maintain, that this is the <i>only</i> view of the crucifixion
and resurrection ever present to the mind of the
Apostles. Jews themselves, they naturally inquired, how
<i>Israel</i>, in particular, stood affected by the unanticipated
death of its Messiah; in what way its relations were changed,
when the offered Prince became the executed victim; and
how far matters would have been different, if, as had been
expected, the Anointed had assumed his rights and taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his power at once; and, instead of making his first advent a
mere preliminary and warning visit "in the flesh," had set
up the kingdom forthwith, and gathered with him his few
followers to "reign on the earth." Had this&mdash;instead of
submission to death, removal, and delay&mdash;been his adopted
course, what would have become of his own nation, who had
rejected him,&mdash;who must have been tried by that law which
was their boast, and under which he came,&mdash;who had long
been notorious offenders against its conditions, and now
brought down its final curse by despising the claims of the
accredited Messiah? They must have been utterly "cut
off," and cast out among the "aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel," "without Messiah," "without hope," "without
God"; for while "circumcision profiteth, <i>if thou keep the
law</i>; yet if thou be a <i>breaker of the law</i>, thy circumcision is
made uncircumcision." Had he come <i>then</i> "to be glorified
in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe,"&mdash;had
he then been "revealed with his mighty angels" (whom
he might have summoned by "legions"),&mdash;it must have
been "in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that knew
not God, nor obeyed the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus
Christ"; to "punish with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord and the glory of his power." The sins
and prospects of Israel being thus terrible, and its rejection
imminent (for Messiah was already in the midst of them),
he withheld his hand; refused to precipitate their just fate;
and said, "Let us give them time, and wait; I will go apart
into the heavens, and peradventure they will repent; only
they must receive me then spiritually, and by hearty faith,
not by carnal right, admitting thus the willing Gentile with
themselves." And so he prepared to die and retire; he did
not permit them to be cut off, but was cut off himself instead;
he restrained the curse of their own law from falling
on them, and rather perished himself by a foul and accursed
lot, which that same law pronounces to be the vilest and
most polluted of deaths. Thus says St. Paul to the Jews:
"He hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a curse for us; for it is written, 'Cursed is every one that
hangeth on a tree.'"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In this way, but for the death of the
Messiah, Israel too must have been lost; and by that event
they received time for repentance, and a way for remission
of sins; found a means of reconciliation still; saw their
providence, which had been lowering for judgment, opening
over them in propitiation once more; the just had died for
the unjust, to bring them to God. What was this delay,&mdash;this
suspension of judgment,&mdash;this opportunity of return
and faith,&mdash;but an instance of "the long-suffering of God,"
with which "he endures the vessels of wrath (Jews) fitted to
destruction, and makes known the riches of his glory on
the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto
glory"? If Christ had not withdrawn awhile, if his power
had been taken up at once, and wielded in stern and legal justice,
a deluge of judgment must have overwhelmed the earth,
and swept away both Jew and Gentile, leaving but a remnant
safe. But in mercy was the mortal life of Jesus turned into
a preluding message of notice and warning, like the tidings
which Noah received of the flood; and as the growing frame
of the ark gave signal to the world of the coming calamity,
afforded an interval for repentance, and made the patriarch,
as he built, a constant "preacher of righteousness"; so the
increasing body of the Church, since the warning retreat of
Christ to heaven, proclaims the approaching "day of the
Lord," admonishes that "all should come to repentance," and
fly betimes to that faith and baptism which Messiah's death
and resurrection have left as an ark of safety. "Once, in
the days of Noah, the long-suffering of God waited while the
ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were
saved by water: a representation, this, of the way in which
baptism (not, of course, carnal washing, but the engagement
of a good conscience with God) saves us now, <i>by the resurrection
of Jesus Christ</i>; who is gone into heaven, and is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the right hand of God; angels, and authorities, and powers,
being made subject to him." Yet "the time is short," and
must be "redeemed"; "it is the last hour"; "the Lord,"
"the coming of the Lord," "the end of all things," are "at
hand."</p>

<p>I have described <i>one</i> aspect, which the death of the Messiah
presented to <i>the Jews</i>; and, in this, we have found
another primary conception, explanatory of the Scriptural
language respecting the cross. Of the two relations in which
this event appeared (the Gentile and the Israelitish), I believe
the former to be by far the most familiar to the New Testament
authors, and to furnish the true interpretation of almost
all their phraseology on the subject. But, as my readers may
have noticed, many passages receive illustration by reference
to either notion; and some may have a meaning compounded
of both. I must not pause to make any minute adjustment
of these claims, on the part of the two interpreting ideas: it
is enough that, either separately or in union, they have now
been taken round the whole circle of apostolic language respecting
the cross, and detected in every difficult passage the
presence of sense and truth, and the absence of all hint of
vicarious atonement.</p>

<p>It was on the <i>unbelieving</i> portion of the Jewish people that
the death of their Messiah conferred the national blessings
and opportunities to which I have adverted. But to <i>the converts</i>
who had been received by him during his mortal life,
and who would have been heirs of his glory, had he assumed
it at once, it was less easy to point out any personal benefits
from the cross. That the Christ had retired from this world
was but a disappointing postponement of their hopes; that
he had perished as a felon was shocking to their pride, and
turned their ancient boast into a present scorn; that he had
become spiritual and immortal made him no longer theirs
"as concerning the flesh," and, by admitting Gentiles with
themselves, set aside their favorite law. So offensive to
them was this unexpected slight on the institutions of Moses,
immemorially reverenced as the ordinances of God, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
became important to give some turn to the death of Jesus,
by which that event might be harmonized with the national
system, and be shown to <i>effect the abrogation of the law,
on principles strictly legal</i>. This was the object of the writer
of the Epistle to the Hebrews; who thus gives us a third idea
of the relations of the cross,&mdash;bearing, indeed, an essential
resemblance to St. Paul's Gentile view, but illustrated in a
manner altogether different. No trace is to be observed here
of Paul's noble glorying in the cross: so studiously is every
allusion to the crucifixion avoided, till all the argumentative
part of the Epistle has been completed, that a reader finds the
conclusion already in sight, without having gained any notion
of <i>the mode</i> of the Lord's death, whether even it was natural
or violent,&mdash;a literal human sacrifice, or a voluntary self-immolation.
Its ignominy and its agonies are wholly unmentioned;
and his mortal infirmities and sufferings are
explained, not as the spontaneous adoptions of previous compassion
in him, but as God's fitting discipline for rendering
him "a merciful and faithful high-priest." They are referred
to in the tone of apology, not of pride; as needing
rather to be reconciled with his office, than to be boldly
expounded as its grand essential. The object of the author
clearly is, to find a place for the death of Jesus among the
Messianic functions; and he persuades the Hebrew Christians
that it is (not a satisfaction for moral guilt, but) a commutation
for the Mosaic Law. In order to understand his
argument, we must advert for a moment to the prejudices
which it was designed to conciliate and correct.</p>

<p>It is not easy for us to realize the feelings with which the
Israelite, in the yet palmy days of the Levitical worship,
would hear of an abrogation of the Law;&mdash;the anger and
contempt with which the mere bigot would repudiate the
suggestion;&mdash;the terror with which the new convert would
make trial of his freedom;&mdash;the blank and infidel feeling
with which he would look round, and find himself drifted
away from his anchorage of ceremony;&mdash;the sinking heart
with which he would hear the reproaches of his countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
against his apostasy. Every authoritative ritual draws towards
itself an attachment too strong for reason and the
sense of right; and transfers the feeling of obligation from
realities to symbols. Among the Hebrews this effect was
the more marked and the more pernicious, because their
ceremonies were in many instances only remotely connected
with any important truth or excellent end; they were separated
by several removes from any spiritual utility. Rites
were enacted to sustain other rites; institution lay beneath
institution, through so many successive steps, that the crowning
principle at the summit easily passed out of sight. To
keep alive the grand truth of the Divine Unity, there was a
gorgeous temple worship; to perform this worship there was
a priesthood; to support the priesthood there were (among
other sources of income) dues paid in the form of sacrifice;
to provide against the non-payment of dues there were penalties;
to prevent an injurious pressure of these penalties, there
were exemptions, as in cases of sickness; and to put a check
on trivial claims of exemption, it must be purchased by submission
to a fee, under name of an atonement. Wherever
such a system is received as divine, and based on the same
authority with the great law of duty, it will always, by its
definiteness and precision, attract attention from graver moral
obligations. Its materiality renders it calculable: its account
with the conscience can be exactly ascertained: as it has little
obvious utility to men, it appears the more directly paid to
God: it is regarded as the special means of pleasing him, of
placating his anger, and purchasing his promises. Hence it
may often happen, that the more the offences against the
spirit of duty, the more are rites multiplied in propitiation;
and the harvest of ceremonies and that of crimes ripen together.</p>

<p>At a state not far from this had the Jews arrived when
Christianity was preached. Their moral sentiments were so
far perverted, that they valued nothing in themselves, in comparison
with their legal exactitude, and hated all beyond
themselves for their want of this. They were eagerly expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the Deliverer's kingdom, nursing up their ambition
for his triumphs; curling the lip, as the lash of oppression
fell upon them, in suppressed anticipation of vengeance; satiating
a temper, at once fierce and servile, with dreams of
Messiah's coming judgment, when the blood of the patriarchs
should be the title of the world's nobles, and the everlasting
reign should begin in Jerusalem. Why was the hour
delayed? they impatiently asked themselves. Was it that
they had offended Jehovah, and secretly sinned against some
requirement of his law? And then they set themselves to a
renewed precision, a more slavish punctiliousness than before.
Ascribing their continued depression to their imperfect
legal obedience, they strained their ceremonialism tighter
than ever; and hoped to be soon justified from their past sins,
and ready for the mighty prince and the latter days.</p>

<p>What, then, must have been the feeling of the Hebrew,
when told that all his punctualities had been thrown away,&mdash;that,
at the advent, faith in Jesus, not obedience to the law,
was to be the title to admission,&mdash;and that the redeemed
at that day would be, not the scrupulous Pharisee, whose
dead works would be of no avail, but all who, with the heart,
have worthily confessed the name of the Lord Jesus? What
doctrine could be more unwelcome to the haughty Israelite?
it dashed his pride of ancestry to the ground. It brought to
the same level with himself the polluted Gentile,&mdash;whose
presence would alone render all unclean in the Messiah's
kingdom. It proved his past ritual anxieties to have been
all wasted. It cast aside for the future the venerated law;
left it in neglect to die; and made all the apparatus of Providence
for its maintenance end in absolutely nothing. Was
then the Messiah to supersede, and not to vindicate, the law?
How different this from the picture which prophets had drawn
of his golden age, when Jerusalem was to be the pride of
the earth, and her temple the praise of nations, sought by
the feet of countless pilgrims, and decked with the splendor
of their gifts! How could a true Hebrew be justified in a
life without law? How think himself safe in a profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
which was without temple, without priest, without altar,
without victim?</p>

<p>Not unnaturally, then, did the Hebrews regard with reluctance
two of the leading features of Christianity; the
death of the Messiah, and the freedom from the law. The
Epistle addressed to them was designed to soothe their uneasiness,
and to show that, if the Mosaic institutions were
superseded, it was in conformity with principles and analogies
contained within themselves. With great address, the writer
links the two difficulties together, and makes the one explain
the other. He finds a ready means of effecting this, in the
sacrificial ideas familiar to every Hebrew; for by representing
the death of Jesus as a commutation for legal observances,
he is only ascribing to it an operation acknowledged to
have place in the death of every lamb slain as a sin-offering
at the altar. These offerings were a distinct recognition, on
the part of the Levitical code, of a principle of <i>equivalents</i> for
its ordinances; a proof that, under certain conditions, they
might yield: nothing more, therefore, was necessary, than to
show that the death of Christ established those conditions.
And such a method of argument was attended by this advantage,
that, while the <i>practical end</i> would be obtained of
terminating all ceremonial observance, the law was yet treated
as <i>in theory</i> perpetual; not as ignominiously abrogated, but
as legitimately commuted. Just as the Israelite, in paying
his offering at the altar to compensate for ritual omissions,
recognized thereby the claims of the law, while he obtained
impunity for its neglect; so, if Providence could be shown to
have provided a legal substitute for the system, its authority
was acknowledged at the moment that its abolition was secured.</p>

<p>Let us advert, then, to the functions of the Mosaic sin-offerings,
to which the writer has recourse to illustrate his
main position. They were of the nature of a <i>mulct or acknowledgment
rendered for unconscious or inevitable disregard
of ceremonial liabilities, and contraction of ceremonial uncleanness</i>.
Such uncleanness might be incurred from various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
causes; and, while unremoved by the appointed methods of
purification, disqualified from attendance at the sanctuary,
and "cut off" "the guilty" "from among the congregation."
To touch a dead body, to enter a tent where a corpse lay,
rendered a person "unclean for seven days"; to come in
contact with a forbidden animal, a bone, a grave, to be next
to any one struck with sudden death, to be afflicted with
certain kinds of bodily disease and infirmity, unwittingly to
lay a finger on a person unclean, occasioned defilement, and
necessitated a purification or an atonement. Independently
of these offences, enforced upon the Israelite by the accidents
of life, it was not easy for even the most cautious worshipper
to keep pace with the complicated series of petty debts which
the law of ordinances was always running up against him.
If his offering had an invisible blemish; if he omitted a tithe,
because "he wist it not"; or inadvertently fell into arrear,
by a single day, with respect to a known liability; if absent
from disease, he was compelled to let his ritual account accumulate;
"though it be hidden from him," he must "be guilty,
and bear his iniquity," and bring his victim. On the birth
of a child, the mother, after the lapse of a prescribed period,
made her pilgrimage to the temple, presented her sin-offering,
and "the priest made atonement for her." The poor
leper, long banished from the face of men, and unclean by
the nature of his disease, became a debtor to the sanctuary,
and on return from his tedious quarantine brought his lamb
of atonement, and departed thence, clear from neglected obligations
to his law. It was impossible, however, to provide by
specific enactment for every case of ritual transgression and
impurity, arising from inadvertence or necessity. Scarcely
could it be expected that the courts of worship themselves
would escape defilement, from imperfections in the offerings,
or unconscious disqualification in people or in priest. To clear
off the whole invisible residue of such sins, an annual "day
of atonement" was appointed; the people thronged the avenues
and approaches of the tabernacle; in their presence a
kid was slain for their own transgressions, and for the high-priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the more dignified expiation of a heifer; charged with
the blood of each successively, he sprinkled not only the
exterior altar open to the sky, but, passing through the first
and holy chamber into the Holy of Holies (never entered
else), he touched, with finger dipped in blood, the sacred lid
(the Mercy-seat) and foreground of the Ark. At that moment,
while he yet lingers behind the veil, the purification is
complete; on no worshipper of Israel does any legal unholiness
rest; and were it possible for the high-priest to remain
in that interior retreat of Jehovah, still protracting the expiatory
act, so long would this national purity continue, and the
debt of ordinances be effaced as it arose. But he must return;
the sanctifying rite must end; the people be dismissed;
the priests resume the daily ministrations; the law open its
stern account afresh; and in the mixture of national exactitude
and neglects, defilements multiply again till the recurring
anniversary lifts off the burden once more. Every year,
then, the necessity comes round of "making atonement for
the holy sanctuary," "for the tabernacle," "for the altar,"
"for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation."
Yet, though requiring periodical renewal, the rite, so far as it
went, had an efficacy which no Hebrew could deny; for ceremonial
sins, unconscious or inevitable (to which all atonement
was limited<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>), it was accepted as an indemnity; and put it
beyond doubt that Mosaic obedience was commutable.</p>

<p>Such was the system of ideas, by availing himself of which
the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews would persuade his
correspondents to forsake their legal observances. "You can
look without uneasiness," he suggests, "on your ritual omissions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
when the blood of some victim has been presented instead,
and the penetralia of your sanctuary have been sprinkled
with the offering: well, on no other terms would I soothe
your anxiety; precisely such equivalent sacrifice does Christianity
exhibit, only of so peculiar a nature, that, for <i>all</i> ceremonial
neglects, intentional no less than inadvertent, you may
rely upon indemnity." The Jews entertained a belief respecting
their temple, which enabled the writer to give a singular
force and precision to his analogy. They conceived that the
tabernacle of their worship was but the copy of a divine
structure, devised by God himself, made by no created hand,
and preserved eternally in heaven: this was "the true tabernacle,
which the Lord pitched, and not man"; which no
mortal had beheld, except Moses in the mount, that he might
"make all things according to that pattern"; within whose
Holy of Holies dwelt no emblem or emanation of God's
presence, but his own immediate Spirit; and the celestial
furniture of which required, in proportion to its dignity, the
purification of a nobler sacrifice, and the ministrations of a
diviner priest, than befitted the "worldly sanctuary" below.
And who then can mistake the meaning of Christ's departure
from this world, or doubt what office he conducts above?
He is called by his ascension to the pontificate of heaven;
consecrated, "not after the law of any carnal commandment,
but after the power of an endless life"; he drew aside the veil
of his mortality, and passed into the inmost court of God: and
as he must needs "have somewhat to offer," he takes the only
blood he had ever shed,&mdash;which was his own,&mdash;and, like
the High-Priest before the Mercy-seat, sanctifies therewith the
people that stand without, "redeeming the transgressions"
which "the first covenant" of rites entailed. And he has
not returned; still is he hid within that holiest place; and
still the multitude he serves turn thither a silent and expectant
gaze; he prolongs the purification still; and while he
appears not, no other rites can be resumed, nor any legal
defilement be contracted. Thus, meanwhile, ordinances cease
their obligation, and the sin against them has lost its power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
How different this from the offerings of Jerusalem, whose
temple was but the "symbol and shadow" of that sanctuary
above. In the Hebrew "sacrifices there was a remembrance
again made of sins every year"; "the high-priest annually
entered the holy place"; being but a mortal, he could not go
in with his own blood and <i>remain</i>, but must take that of other
creatures and <i>return</i>; and hence it became "not possible that
the blood of bulls and of goats should <i>take away</i> sins," for
instantly they began to accumulate again. But to the very
nature of Christ's offering a perpetuity of efficacy belongs;
bearing no other than "<i>his own</i> blood," he was immortal
when his ministration began, and "ever liveth to make his
intercession"; he could "not offer himself often, for then
must he often have suffered since the foundation of the
world,"&mdash;and "it is appointed unto men <i>only once</i> to die";
so that "<i>once for all</i> he entered into the holy place, and
obtained a redemption that is <i>perpetual</i>"; "<i>once</i> in the end
of the world hath he appeared, and by sacrificing himself
hath absolutely <i>put away</i> sin"; "this man, after he had
offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right
hand of God," "for by one offering he hath perfected for
ever them that are sanctified." The ceremonial, then, with
its periodical transgressions and atonements, is suspended;
the services of the outer tabernacle cease, for the holiest of
all is made manifest; one who is "priest for ever" dwells
therein;&mdash;one "consecrated for evermore," "holy, harmless,
undefiled, in his celestial dwelling quite separate from sinners;
who needeth not <i>daily</i>, as those high-priests, to offer up sacrifice,
first for his own sins, and then for the people's; for this
he did <i>once for all</i> when he offered up himself."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p><p>Nor is it in its perpetuity alone that the efficacy of the
Christian sacrifice transcends the atonements of the law; it
removes a higher order of ritual transgressions. It cannot
be supposed, indeed, that Messiah's life is no nobler offering
than that of a creature from the herd or flock, and will confer
no more immunity. Accordingly, it goes beyond those "<i>sins
of ignorance</i>," those ceremonial inadvertences, for which alone
there was remission in Israel; and reaches to <i>voluntary</i> neglects
of the sacerdotal ordinances; insuring indemnity for
legal omissions, when incurred not simply by the accidents
of the flesh, but even by intention of the conscience. This
is no greater boon than the dignity of the sacrifice requires;
and does but give to his people below that living relation of
soul to God which he himself sustains above. "If the blood
of bulls and of goats ... sanctifieth to the purifying of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purify
(even) your conscience from dead works (ritual observances)
to serve the living God!" Let then the ordinances go, and
the Lord "put his laws <i>into the mind</i>, and write them <i>in the
heart</i>"; and let all have "boldness to enter into the holiest
by the blood of Jesus, by this new and living way which he
hath consecrated for us"; "provoking each other to love
and to good works."</p>

<p>See, then, in brief, the objection of the Hebrews to the
Gospel; and the reply of their instructor. They said: "What
a blank is this; you have no temple, no priest, no ritual!
How is it that, in his ancient covenant, God is so strict about
ceremonial service, and permits no neglect, however incidental,
without atonement; yet in this new economy throws the
whole system away, letting us run up an everlasting debt to
a law confessedly unrepealed, without redemption of it or
atonement for it?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not without redemption and atonement," replies their
evangelical teacher; "temple, sacrifice, priest, remain to us
also, only glorified into proportions worthy of a heavenly
dispensation; our temple, in the skies; our sacrifice, Messiah's
mortal person; our priest, his ever-living spirit. How poor
the efficacy of your former offerings! year after year, your
ritual debt began again: for the blood dried and vanished
from the tabernacle which it purified; the priest returned
from the inner shrine; and when there, he stood, with the
interceding blood, before the emblem, not the reality, of
God. But Christ, not at the end of a year, but at the end of
the great world-era of the Lord, has come to offer up himself,&mdash;no
lamb so unblemished as he; his voluntary and immortal
spirit, than which was nothing ever more divinely consecrate,
becomes officiating priest, and strikes his own person with
immolating blow; it falls and bleeds on earth, as on the outer
altar, standing on the threshold of the sanctuary of heaven:
thither he ascends with the memorials of his death, vanishes
into the Holy of Holies of the skies, presents himself before
the very living God, and sanctifies the temple there and
worshippers here; saying to us, 'Drop now for ever the legal
burdens that weigh you down; doubt not that you are free,
as my glorified spirit here, from the defilements you are wont
to dread; I stay behind this veil of visible things, to clear you
of all such taint, and put away such sin eternally. Trust,
then, in me, and take up the freedom of your souls: burst the
dead works, that cling round your conscience like cerements
of the grave; and rise to me, by the living power of duty,
and a loving allegiance to God.'"</p>

<p>So far, then, as the death of Christ is treated in Scripture
dogmatically, rather than historically, its effects are viewed in
contrast with the different order of things which must have
been expected, had he, as Messiah, <i>not</i> died. And thus
regarded, it presented itself to the minds of the Apostles in
three relations:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, to the Gentiles, whom it drew in to be subjects
of the Messiah, by breaking down the barriers of his Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
personality, and rendering him spiritual as well as
immortal.</p>

<p>Secondly, to the unbelieving Jews; whom his retirement
from this world delivered from the judgment due to them, on
the principles of their own law, both for their <i>general</i> violation
of the <i>conditions</i> of their covenant, and for their positive
rejection of him. His absence reopened their opportunities;
and to tender them this act of long-suffering, he took on himself
the death which had been incurred by them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to the believing Jews; the terms of whose discipleship
the Messiah's death had changed, destroying all the
benefits of their lineage, and substituting an act of the mind,
the simpler claim of faith. It was therefore a commutation
for the Ritual Law, and gave them impunity and atonement
for all its violations.</p>

<p>With the last two of these relations, beyond their remarkable
historical interest, we have no personal concern. The
first remains, and ever will remain, worthy of the glorious joy
with which Paul regarded and expounded it. God has committed
the rule of this world to no exclusive prince, and no
sacerdotal power, and no earthly majesty; but to one whose
spirit, too divine to be limited to place and time, broke through
clouds of sorrow into the clearest heaven; and thither has
since been drawing our human love, though for ages now he
has been unseen and immortal. An impartial God, a holy
and spiritual law, an infinite hope for all men, are given to
us by that generous cross.</p>

<p>It is evident that all three of the relations which I have
described belonged to the death of Jesus, <i>in his capacity of
Messiah</i>; and could have had no existence if he had not
borne this character, but had been simply a private martyr to
his convictions. The foregoing exposition gives a direct
answer to the inquiry, pressed without the slightest pertinence
upon the Unitarian, why the phraseology of the cross
is never found applied to Paul or Peter, or any other noble
confessor, who died in attestation of the truth; why "no
record is given that we are justified by the blood of Stephen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
or that he bare our sins in his own body, and made reconciliation
for us."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> I know not why such a question should be
submitted to us; we have assuredly no concern with it;
having never dreamt that the Apostles could have written as
they did respecting the death on Calvary, if they had thought
of it only as a scene of martyrdom. We have passed under
review the whole language of the New Testament on this
subject; and in the interpretation of it have <i>not even once</i> had
recourse to this, which is said to be our only view of the
cross. We have seen the Apostles justly announcing their
Lord's death as a <i>proper propitiation</i>; because it placed
whole classes of men, without any meritorious change in their
character, in saving relations: declaring it a <i>strict substitute</i>
for others' punishment; on the ground that there were those
who must have perished, if he had not; and that he died and
retired, that they might remain and live: describing it as a
<i>sacrifice which put away sin</i>; because it did that for ever,
which the Levitical atonements achieved for a day: but we
have not found them ever appealing to it either as a satisfaction
to the justice of God, or an example of martyrdom to
men. The Trinitarians have one idea of this event themselves;
and their fancy provides their opponents with one
idea of it; of the former not a trace exists, on any page
of Scripture; and of the latter the Unitarian need not avail
himself at all, in explaining the language whereof it is said
to be his solitary key.</p>

<p>Nowhere, then, in Scripture do we meet with anything
corresponding with the prevailing notions of vicarious redemption;
everywhere, and most emphatically in the personal
instructions of our Lord, do we find a doctrine of
forgiveness, and an idea of salvation, utterly inconsistent
with it. He spake often of the unqualified clemency of God
to his returning children; never once of the satisfaction
demanded by his justice. He spake of the joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth; but was silent on the sacrificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
faith, without which penitence is said to be unavailing.
Nor did he, like his modern disciples, teach that there are
<i>two separate salvations</i>, which must follow each other in a
fixed order: first, redemption from the penalty, secondly,
from the spirit, of sin; pardon for the past, before sanctification
in the present; a removal of the "hinderance in God,"
previous to its annihilation in ourselves. If indeed there
were in Christianity two deliverances, discriminated and successive,
it would be more in accordance with its spirit to
invert this order;&mdash;to recall from alienation first, and announce
forgiveness afterwards; to restore from guilt, before
cancelling the penalty; and permit the <i>healing</i> to anticipate
the <i>pardoning</i> love. At least, there would seem, in such
arrangement, to be a greater jealousy for the holiness of
the divine law, a severer reservation of God's complacency
for those who have broken from the service of sin, than
in the system which proclaims impunity to the rebel will,
ere yet its estrangement is renounced. If the outward remission
precedes the inward sanctification, then does God
admit to favor the yet unsanctified; guilt keeps us in no
exile from him: and though the Holy Spirit is to follow
afterwards, it becomes the peculiar office of the cross to lift
us as we are, with every stain upon the soul and every vile
habit unretraced, from the brink of perdition to the assurance
of glory: the divine lot is given to us, before the
divine love is awakened in us; and the heirs of heaven have
yet to become the children of holiness. With what consistency
can the advocates of such an economy accuse its
opponents of dealing lightly with sin, of deluding men into a
false trust, and administering seductive flatteries to human
nature?<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> What! shall we, who plant in every soul of sin a
hell, whence no foreign force, no external God, can pluck
us, any more than they can tear us from our identity,&mdash;we,
who hide the fires of torment in no viewless gulf, but make
them ubiquitous as guilt,&mdash;we, who suffer no outward agent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
from Eden, or the Abyss, or Calvary, to encroach upon the
solitude of man's responsibility, and confuse the simplicity
of conscience,&mdash;we, who teach that God will not, and even
cannot, spare the froward, till they be froward no more, but
must permit the burning lash to fall, till they cry aloud for
mercy, and throw themselves freely into his embrace;&mdash;shall
we be rebuked for a lax administration of peace, by those
who think that a moment may turn the alien into the elect?
It is no flattery of our nature, to reverence deeply its moral
capacities: we only discern in them the more solemn trust,
and see in their abuse the fouler shame. And it is not of
what men <i>are</i>, but of what they <i>might be</i>, that we encourage
noble and cheerful thoughts. Doubtless, we think exaggeration
possible (which our opponents apparently do not) even
in the portraiture of their actual character: and perhaps we
are not the less likely to awaken true convictions of sin, that
we strive to speak of it with the voice of discriminative justice,
instead of the monotonous thunders of vengeance; and
to draw its image in the natural tints provided by the conscience,
rather than in the preternatural flame-color mingled
in the crucibles of hell.</p>

<p>In making <i>penal</i> redemption and <i>moral</i> redemption separate
and successive, the vicarious scheme, we submit, is
inconsistent with the Christian idea of salvation. Not that
we take the second, and reject the first, as our Trinitarian
friends imagine; nor that we invert their order. We accept
them both; putting them, however, not in succession, but in
super-position, so that they coalesce. The power and the
punishment of sin perish together; and together begin the
holiness and the bliss of heaven. Whatever extracts the
poison cools the sting: nor can the divine vigor of spiritual
health enter, without its freedom and its joy. That there can
be any separate dealings with our past guilt and with our
present character, is not a truth of God, but a fiction of the
schools. The sanctification of the one is the redemption of
the other. The mind given up to passion, or chained to
self, or anyhow alienated from the love and life divine,
dwells, whatever be its faith, in the dark and terrible abyss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
while he, and he only, that, in the freedom and tranquillity
of great affections, communes with God and toils for men,
understands the meaning, and wins the promises, of heaven.
Am I asked: "What, then, is to persuade the sinful heart
thus to draw near to God;&mdash;what, but a proclamation of
absolute pardon, can break down the secret distrust, which
keeps our nature back, wrapped in the reserve of conscious
guilt?" I reply; however much these fears and hesitations
might cling round us, and restrain us from the mystic Deity
of Nature, they can have no place in our intercourse with the
Father whom Jesus represents. It needs only that Christ
be truly his image, to know "that the hinderance is not with
him, but entirely in ourselves";<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to see that there is no
anger in his look; to feel that he invites us to unreserved
confession, and accepts our self-abandonment to him,&mdash;that
he lifts the repentant, prostrate at his feet, and speaks the
words of severe, but truest hope. Am I told, "that only
the gratitude excited by personal rescue from tremendous
danger, by an unconditional and entire deliverance, is capable
of winning our reluctant nature, of opening the soul to the
access of the Divine Spirit, and bringing it to the service of
the Everlasting Will"? I rejoice to acknowledge, that <i>some</i>
such disinterested power must be awakened, some mighty
forces of the heart be called out, ere the regeneration can
take place that renders us children of the Highest; ere we
can break, with true new birth, from the shell of self, and
try and train our wings in the atmosphere of God. The
permanent work of duty must be wrought by the affections;
not by the constraint, however solemn, of hope and fear; no
self-perfectionating process, elaborated by an anxious will,
has warmth enough to ripen the soul's diviner fruits; the
walks of outward morality, and the slopes of deliberate meditation,
it may keep smooth and trim; but cannot make the
true life-blossoms set, as in a garden of the Lord, and the
foliage wave as with the voice of God among the trees. I
gladly admit that, to a believer in the vicarious sacrifice, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
sense of pardon, the love of the Great Deliverer, may well
fulfil this blessed office, of carrying him out of himself in
genuine allegiance to a being most benign and holy. And
perceiving that, if this doctrine were removed, there is not,
<i>in the system of which it forms a part</i>, and which else would
be all terror, anything that could perform the same generous
part, I can understand why it seems to its advocates an
<i>essential</i> power in the renovation of the character. But
great as it may be, within the limits of its own narrow
scheme, ideas possessed of higher moral efficacy are not
wanting, when we pass into a region of nobler and more
Christian thought. Shall we say that the view of the Infinite
Ruler, given in the spoken wisdom or the living spirit of
Christ, has no sanctifying power? Yet where is there any
trace in it of the satisfactionist's redemption? When we sit
at Messiah's feet, that transforming gratitude for an extinguished
penalty, on which the prevailing theology insists, as
its central emotion, becomes replaced by a similar and profounder
sentiment towards the Eternal Father. If to rescue
men from a dreadful fate in the future be a just title to our
reverence, <i>never to have designed</i> that fate claims an affection
yet more devoted; if there be a divine mercy in annihilating
an awful curse, in shedding only blessing there is surely
a diviner still. Shall the love restored to us after long delay,
and in consideration of an equivalent, work mightily on the
heart,&mdash;and shall that which asked no purchase, which has
been veiled by no cloud, which has enfolded us always in its
tranquillity, nor can ever quit the soul opened to receive it,
fail to penetrate the conscience, and dissolve the frosts of our
self-love by some holier flame? Never shall it be found true,
that God must threaten us with vengeance, ere we can feel
the shelter of his grace!</p>

<p>In truth, the Christian idea of salvation cannot be better
illustrated, than by the doubt which has been entertained
respecting the proper translation of my text. Some, referring
it to spiritual redemption, adhere to the common version;
others, seeing that the Apostle Peter is explaining "by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
what power or by what name" he had cured the lame man
at the temple gate, refer the words to this miracle of deliverance,
and render them thus: "Neither is there <i>healing</i> in any
other; for there is none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we can be <i>healed</i>." It matters little
which it is; for whether we speak of body or of mind, Jesus
"<i>saves</i>" us by "<i>making us whole</i>"; by putting forth upon
us a divine and healing power, by which past suffering and
present decrepitude disappear together; which supplies the
defective elements of our nature, cools the burning of inward
fever, or calls into being new senses and perceptions, opening
a diviner universe to our experience. The deformed and
crooked will, bowed by Satan, lo! these many years, and nowise
able to lift up itself, he loosens and makes straight in
uprightness. The moral paralytic, collapsed and prostrate
amid the stir of life, and incapably gazing on the moving
waters in which others find their health, has often started up
at the summons of that voice, though perchance "he wist not
who it was"; and, going his way, has found it to be "the
sabbath," and owned the "work" of one who is in the spirit
of "the Father." From the eye long dark and blind to duty
and to God, he has caused the film to pass away; and shown
the solemn look of life beneath a heaven so tranquil and
sublime. Even the dead of soul, close wrapped in bandages of
selfishness,&mdash;that greediest of graves,&mdash;have been quickened
by his piercing call, and have come forth, to learn, "when
risen," that only in the meekness that can obey is there the
power to command, only in the love that serves is there the
life of heart-felt liberty. To call, then, on the name and trust
in the spirit of Christ, is to invoke the restoring power of God;
to give symmetry and speed to our lame affections, and the
vigor of an athlete to our limping wills. There is not any
Christian <i>salvation</i> that is not thus identical with Christian
<i>perfection</i>: "nor any other name under heaven given among
men, whereby we may be (thus) <i>made whole</i>." Let all that
would "be perfect be thus minded"; seek "the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ"; and they shall find in
him a "power to become the sons of God."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="MEDIATORIAL_RELIGION" id="MEDIATORIAL_RELIGION">MEDIATORIAL RELIGION.</a></h2>

<blockquote class="hangind"><p><i>The Nature of the Atonement, and its Relation to Remission
of Sins and Eternal Life.</i> By <span class="smcap">John M'Leod Campbell</span>.
Cambridge: Macmillan &amp; Co. 1856.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is a strange book. A Greek would have hated it.
A Puritan would have found it savory, even where it was unsound.
Rosenkranz, who has written on the <i>Æsthetik des
Hässlichen</i>, would have been thankful for such a fund of illustration.
Cumbrous, tiresome, monotonous, it has few attractions
for the natural man, who may have a weakness in favor
of pure English and nice grammar. It despises the graces of
carnal literature, and treats all the color and music of language
as the Roundheads treated a cathedral, silencing the
"box of whistles" and smashing the "mighty big angels in
glass." And yet, if you can get over its grating way of delivering
itself, you will find it no barbaric product, but the
utterance of a deep and practised thinker, charged with the
richest experiences of the Christian life, and resolute to clear
them from every tangle of fiction or pretence. Beneath the
uncouth form there is not only severe truth, but great tenderness
and beauty,&mdash;a fine apprehension of the real inner strife
of tempted men, and an intense faith in an open way of escape
from it, without compromise of any sanctity. The author,
though not tuneful in his speech, has the gifts of a true prophet;
and often enables one to fancy what Isaiah might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
been if he had heard nothing but the bagpipe, and had set his
"burdens" to its drone. Whether Mr. Campbell's style has
been formed north of the Tweed, we know not. In any case,
it is trained in the school of Calvinism; is untouched therefore
by any feeling for art; and runs on with a sort of extemporaneous
habit, insufficiently relieved by occasional flashes
of grotesque and forcible expression. It is only in exterior
aspect, however, that he presents the features of the rugged
old Calvinism: and though the first-born of that system and
its younger sons are distinguished like Isaac's children, "Esau
is a hairy man, and Jacob is a smooth man," yet no true patriarch
of the school can be so blind as not to see beneath our
author's goat-skin dress, and know that he is other than the
heir. In fact, the peculiarity of this work as a theological
phenomenon is, that it is a destruction of Calvinism without
any revolt from it,&mdash;an escape from it through its own interior.
Its postulates are not denied. Its phraseology is not
rejected. Its statement of the problem of redemption is in
the main accepted. Its provision for the solution,&mdash;the Incarnation
of the Son,&mdash;is sacredly preserved. Yet these
elements are put into such play as to make it checkmate itself
on its own area. Its definitions are shown to be suicidal; and
its sharp-edged logic is used to cut through the ligaments that
constrain and shape it.</p>

<p>We have spoken first of the <i>style</i> of this book, because it
strikes the reader at the outset, and is not unlikely to repel
him if he is not warned. Of one other feature, derived from
the same school, we must say a word, to qualify the admiration
and gratitude which we shall then ungrudgingly tender to the
author. In common with all the great masters of the "Evangelical"
school, he is too much at home with the Divine economy;
knows too well how the same thing appears from the
finite and the infinite point of view; can tell too surely how
a mixed nature, both divine and human, would feel on looking
from both ends at once; and altogether goes with too
close a search to the "secret place of the Most High." Not
that he speaks unworthily on these high themes; we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
nothing truer to suggest, except more silence. But we must
confess that when a teacher lays down the conditions of divine
possibility, expatiates psychologically on the sentiments of the
Father and the Son, and seems as though he had been allowed
a peep into the autobiography of God, we shrink from
the sharp outlines, and feel that we shall believe more if we
are shown less. With so many soundings taken, and so many
channels buoyed, the sense of the shoreless sea is gone, and
we find only a port of traffic, with coast-lights instead of stars.
The temptation to this theological map-making has always
proved peculiarly strong among the disciples of Geneva: and
the reason is to be found in the very nature of the problem
they have attempted to resolve. Religion has two foci to determine,&mdash;the
divine nature and the human. Athanasius and
the Greek influence fixed the doctrine of the Godhead: Augustine
and the Latin Church defined the spiritual state of
man. The one, it has been said, produced a theology; the
other, an anthropology. In the construction of the former, it
is obvious that the appeal could be made only to positive authority,
whether of Scripture or the Church. On the Nicene
question no one could pretend to have personal insight or
scientific data: it must be decided by arbitrary vote on impressions
of testimony. But for establishing a doctrine of
humanity, the living resources of consciousness and experience
were present with perpetual witness; every proposition advanced
could be confronted with its corresponding reality:
the disciple could not help carrying the dogma inward to the
test of his self-knowledge. The scheme of the Trinity partook
of the nature of a <i>Gnosis</i>, which dwelt apart from the stir of
phenomena, and, having once set and crystallized, could only
be hung up for preservation. The dogmas of human depravity
and helplessness partook of the nature of a <i>Science</i>, coming
in contact with the facts of life and character at every
point. Moral experience had something to say to them: and
unless they could keep good terms with it, they could not
hope to hold their ground. Hence the Augustinian divines
have been constrained to seek a <i>philosophy</i> of religion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to collate the text of their Scriptural system with the running
paraphrase of actual life. No writers have contributed so
much to lay bare the inmost springs of human action and
emotion; have tracked with so much subtilty the windings
of guilty self-deception, or so found the secret sorrow that
lies at the core of every unconsecrated joy. If we must concede
to the Roman Catholic casuists and the problems of the
confessional the merit of creating an ethical Art embodied in
systems of rules, we owe to the deeper Evangelical spirit,
whether in its action or its reaction, the ground-lines of an ethical
Philosophy;&mdash;or, if you deny that such a thing as yet
exists, at least the true idea and undying quest of it. The
disciples of Augustine, belonging to an anthropological school,
have been naturally distinguished by a reflective and psychologic
habit.</p>

<p>If it was the function of the Greek period to settle the doctrine
of God, and of its Latin successor to define the nature
of man, it was the aim of the <i>Reformation</i>, leaving these two
extremes undisturbed, to find the way of mediation between
them. So long as the great sacerdotal Church, living continuator
of Christ's presence, was intrusted with the business, private
Christians wanted no theory on the subject; all nice
questions went into the ecclesiastical closet and disappeared.
But as soon as ever the hierarchy fell out of this position,
there was an immense void left to be filled. On the one
hand, Infinite Holiness, quite alienated; on the other, Human
Pravity, quite helpless: how was any approximation to be
rendered conceivable? True, the great original Mediation on
Calvary, which the papal priesthood pretended to prolong, remained;
for it was fixed in history. But it lay a great way
off, a fact in the old past; and its intervention was required
to-day by Melancthon, and Carlstadt, and a whole generation
quite remote from it. How was its power to be fetched into
the present? how applied to men walking about in Wittenberg
or Zürich? This was the problem which flew open by
the cancelling of the Romish credentials: and the various answers
to it constitute the body of Protestant theology. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
one point they all agree, that, to replace the priestly media
that are thrust out, <i>Personal Faith</i> is the element that must
be brought in. In what way this subjective state of the individual
mind draws or appropriates the efficacy of the Incarnation;
in what <i>order</i> the redeeming process runs among the
three given terms,&mdash;the alienated Father, the mediating Son,
the believing disciple; whether any part of the process is
moral and real, or all is legal and virtual;&mdash;these are questions
which the Reformation has found it easier to open than
to close. But answer them as you will, they entangle your
thoughts in the mutual relations and sentiments of three persons;
and cannot be discussed without establishing some principles
of moral psychology, as the common grounds of intercommunion
between minds finite and infinite, and dealing with
hypothetical problems of divine as well as human casuistry.
Hence the inevitable tendency of the doctrine of Mediation
to venture on a natural history of the Divine Mind,&mdash;to construct
a drama of Providence and Grace, with plot too artfully
wrought for the free hand of Heaven, and traits too specific
and minute for reverent contemplation.</p>

<p>It is deeply instructive to observe the pulsation of religious
thought in men. Revealed religion is ever passing into natural,
and natural returning to re-interpret the revealed. We
can almost see the steps by which sacred history was converted
into dogma; while dogma, assumed in turn as the starting-point,
is ever producing new readings of the history. This
world may be regarded as a <i>human theatre</i>, where the Wills
of men perform the parts; or as the stage of <i>Divine agency</i>,
using the visible actors as the executants of an invisible
thought. Its vicissitudes, presented in the former aspect,
yield only history; in the latter, give rise to doctrine. Noticed
by Tacitus, the life of Christ is a provincial incident of
Tiberius's reign, and his death a judicial act of Pontius Pilate's
government. In the three first Gospels and the book of
Acts, the crucifixion is still the act of wicked or misguided
men, inflicted on an expostulating victim; not, however, without
being <i>foreseen</i> as the appointed precursor of a resurrection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The event is thus in the main simply historical; but
with a divine comment which gives it an incipient theological
significance. It appears under another aspect in the Gospel
of John; there, Christ not only foresaw, but <i>determined</i> his
own death: his life "no man taketh it from him," but he "lays
it down of himself"; he is not merely the submissive medium,
but the spontaneous co-agent of a Divine intent. Finally,
in St. Paul,&mdash;to whom the person and ministry of Christ
were unfamiliar, who, as a disciple of his heavenly life, looked
back upon them from a higher point,&mdash;the historical aspect
almost wholly disappears in the ideal; and the cross becomes
the Gospel, the wisdom of God and the power of God, the
self-sacrifice of the Son the reconciling way to the Father, the
very focus and symbol of all the mystery and mercy comprised
in humanity. The movement of thought through these
successive stages is obvious. An event is at first accepted as
it arises. But in proportion as its concrete impression retires,
the need becomes more urgent to find its function: instinctive
search is made for all those elements, accessories, and effects
of it, which promise to bring out its meaning and idea, until
at last its doctrine absorbs itself, and enters the human mind
as a permanent factor of positive religion. It is thus that
the great antitheses, of Law and Gospel, of the Natural and
the Spiritual man, of dead Works and living Faith, of self-seeking
enmity and self-surrendering reconciliation with God,
have settled upon the consciousness of Christendom, and
grown into the very substance of its experience. They have
become part of its natural religion. But in this character
they may, conversely, be taken as the initiative of a new version
of the history whence they sprung. They could not be
born into unmixed and formed existence at once; but, like all
new affections, must feel their way out of an early indeterminate
state, into clear self-apprehension and settled purity.
The testimony of the Christian conscience needs time to become
articulate and collected. The shadow of human guilt
may lie so dark upon the mind, the dawn of the divine holiness
may so dazzle the inward vision, that blindness in part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
may linger for a while; and the eye, in very opening to
Christ's healing touch, may fail to see. Once accustomed to
the new light of life, men are no longer occupied with it alone,
but find in it a medium for truer discernment of objects
around. The special sentiments awakened by the Gospel test
themselves afresh, like any other theory, by being fully lived
out, and tried as experiments upon the soul. The type of
character,&mdash;the edition of human nature,&mdash;in which they
take embodiment, becomes a distinct object of critical appreciation;
and while all its deep expressive traits speak for the
inner truth whence they are moulded, every mixture of disharmony
or defect calls for some revision of idea. In the
thirsty spiritual state to which men were reduced on the eve
of the Reformation, they drank up with intense eagerness the
most turbid supplies of evangelical doctrine. With purer
health and finer perception they become aware that not all
was water of life; and that coarse notions of the nature of
justice, the conditions of mercy, and the measurement of sin,
were intermixed and must become mere sediment. Cleared
of these, the theory is taken back to the facts of revelation,
and so washed through them, that they may also emerge as
from a sprinkling of regeneration. Through such re-baptism
does our author, furnished with a purified conception of
"atonement," pass the history of Christ.</p>

<p>In looking for the whereabouts of the atonement, we are
guided, as in search for the pole-star, by two pointers whose
indications we are to follow. Its function was double,&mdash;to
cancel a guilty past, to make a holy future: and it must be
of such a nature as to disappoint neither of these conditions.
In determining its form, the great anxiety of theologians hitherto
has been to fit it for its <i>retrospective</i> action, and disembarrass
the problem of salvation of the burden of accumulated
sin. It is Mr. Campbell's distinction that he lays the superior
stress on its <i>prospective</i> action, and requires that it shall positively
heal the sickness of our nature, and evolve thence a
real and living righteousness. God's moral perfectness could
be satisfied with nothing less. If, indeed, He looked on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
guilt merely as an obstacle to our "salvation," and desired to
remove it as a hinderance out of the way,&mdash;if He rather
sought a pretext for making us happy than a provision for
drawing us to goodness,&mdash;then the work of Christ might be
so devised as simply to tear out the defiled page of the past,
and register an infinite credit not our own, without inherent
care for ulterior personal holiness. But were it so, the divine
<i>love</i> would amount only to an unrighteous desire for our happiness,
and the divine <i>righteousness</i> to an unloving repulsion
from our sin. Such spurious analysis corresponds with no
reality; and in the truth of things there can be no heavenly
affection that is not holy, nor any holiness that is not affectionate.</p>

<p>"While in reference to the not uncommon way of regarding
this subject which represents righteousness and holiness
as opposed to the sinner's salvation, and mercy and love as on
his side, I freely concede that all the Divine attributes were,
in one view, against the sinner, in that they called for the due
expression of God's wrath against sin in the history of redemption:
I believe, on the other hand, that the justice, the
righteousness, the holiness of God, have an aspect according
to which they, as well as his mercy, appear as intercessors for
man, and crave his salvation. Justice may be contemplated
as according to sin its due; and there is in righteousness, as
we are conscious to it, what testifies that sin should be miserable.
But <i>justice</i>, looking at the sinner not simply as the fit
subject of punishment, but as existing in a moral condition of
unrighteousness, and so its own opposite, must desire that the
sinner should cease to be in that condition; should cease to be
unrighteous, should become righteous: righteousness in God
craving for righteousness in man, with a craving which the
realization of righteousness in man alone can satisfy. So also
of holiness. In one view it repels the sinner, and would banish
him to outer darkness, because of its repugnance to sin.
In another, it is pained by the continued existence of sin and
unholiness, and must desire that the sinner should cease to be
sinful. So that the sinner, conceived of as awakening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
consciousness of his own evil state, and saying to himself, 'By
sin I have destroyed myself. Is there yet hope for me in
God?'&mdash;should hear an encouraging answer, not only from
the love and mercy of God, but also from his very righteousness
and holiness. We must not forget, in considering the
response that is in conscience to the charge of sin and guilt,
that, though the fears which accompany that response are
partly the effect of a dawning of light, they also in part arise
from remaining darkness. He who is able to interpret the
voice of God within him truly, and with full spiritual intelligence
will be found saying, not only, 'There is to me cause
for fear in the righteousness and holiness of God,' but also,
'There is room for hope for me in the Divine righteousness
and holiness.' And when gathering consolation from the meditation
of the name of the Lord, that consolation will be not
only, 'Surely the Divine mercy desires to see me happy rather
than miserable,' but also, 'Surely the Divine righteousness
desires to see me righteous,&mdash;the Divine holiness desires to
see me holy,&mdash;my continuing unrighteous and unholy is as
grieving to God's righteousness and holiness as my misery
through sin is to his pity and love.' 'Good and righteous is
the Lord, therefore will he teach sinners the way which they
should choose.' 'A just God and a Saviour'; not as the
harmony of a seeming opposition, but 'a Saviour, <i>because</i> a
just God.'"&mdash;p. 29.</p>

<p>From this justly-conceived passage the characteristics of
Mr. Campbell's theory may already be divined. He sets his
faith on a concrete, living, indivisible God, whom you can
never understand by laying out His abstract attributes one by
one, with their separate requirements, and then putting them
together again to compute the resultant. He insists on the
absolute dominance of a moral and spiritual idea throughout
the revealed economy: of this nature is the evil to be met,&mdash;sin
and estrangement; of this nature is the good to be reached,&mdash;righteousness
and reconciliation; and only of this nature
can be the mediation which effects the change; related upward
to the Father and downward to men, in a way accordant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with the laws of conscience, and intelligible by its self-light.
He craves, therefore, a natural juncture, a real causal nexus,
between the several parts of the process, to the exclusion of
all forensic fictions and arbitrary scene-shifting and sovereign
<i>tours-de-force</i>. In short, he will have no tricks passed off, no
<i>quasi</i>-transformations upon the conscience; he feels the moral
world to be above the range of mere miracle; any change in
it irreducible to its solemn laws would <i>ipso facto</i> fall out of
it and become a mere dynamical surprise. Of <i>physical</i> miracle
our author avails himself to the full amount; the incarnation
of the Son of God being, with him, as with others, the
central fact and essential medium of Christian redemption.
But the august power thus <i>super</i>naturally set up&mdash;the Person
at once divine and human&mdash;works out his great problem
<i>naturally</i>, without requiring the suspension of one rule of
right, or holding any magical dealings with the character of God
or man. His problem, therefore, is to show how the life and
death of Christ&mdash;considered as God in humanity&mdash;were fitted,
and alone fitted, to blot out the sins of the world before
God, and to introduce among men a new state of real righteousness
and eternal life.</p>

<p>The common Evangelical scheme of redemption so far affects
to be deduced from certain general principles, and to
render the way of redemption <i>conceivable</i>, that it is stigmatized
as <i>rationalistic</i> by Catholics and Anglicans. It is so,
however, only in the sense of hanging well together, and
serving the purpose of a <i>theological Mnemonic</i> to those who
want a religion ready more than deep. In the higher sense,
of occupying any natural ground of reason, it does not earn
its reproach. The propositions which it lays down, as to the
inability of a holy nature to forgive unless circuitously and
with compensation, and as to the commutability of either penal
liabilities or moral attributes, are without any support from
our primary sentiments of right and wrong, and could be carried
out by no sane man in the conduct of life. The doctrine
is taught in two principal forms;&mdash;the earlier and more exact
scheme of "<i>Satisfaction</i>," elaborated by Anselm of Canterbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and perfected by Owen and Edwards; and the modern
theory of "<i>Public Justice</i>," maintained in the writings of
Dr. Pye Smith and Dr. Payne, and prevailing wherever the
first decadence from the old Calvinism is going on. The first
of these prepares its ground by laying down these principles
as fundamental;&mdash;that the connection between sin and suffering
is inviolably secured on the veracity of God; that
"when we have done all, we are unprofitable servants," and
have only rendered our strict due; that, far from "doing all,"
we have done and can do nothing, except accumulate guilt,
which, measure it as you will,&mdash;by the majesty of the authority
defied, or the multitude of the offenders and their sins,&mdash;is
practically of infinite amount. Here, then, is a case of
utter despair: infinite debt; nothing to pay; remission impossible;
punishment eternal; death unattainable. But we are
brought into the labyrinth on one side, to emerge from it
on the other. While <i>men</i> can only multiply demerit, there
are natures conceivable to which merit is possible. A Divine
Person, laying aside a blessedness inherently his, and assuming
sorrow not his own, and doing this out of a pure love, fulfils
the conditions; and when the Son takes on him our
humanity, the act, carried out unto the end, has a merit in it
which in amount is a full set-off against the guilt of men.
Still, this only leaves us with two opposite funds&mdash;of infinite
good desert and infinite ill desert&mdash;which sit apart and unrelated.
In due course, the one ought to have a boundless reward,
the other a boundless punishment. But to render his
affluence available for our debt, the Son consummates his self-sacrifice,
substitutes himself for us as the object of retribution,
and dies once for all,&mdash;one infinite death for many finite hereafters
of woe. The Father's justice is satisfied; the allotment
of suffering to sin has been accurately observed; His
desire to pardon is released from its restraint. Having dealt
with the person of the Son as if it were mankind, He may
deal with mankind as if they were the Son, and look upon
them as clothed with a perfect obedience.</p>

<p>The wholly artificial structure of this scheme, which is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
greatest condemnation, has been its chief security. It is by
approaching within conducting-distance of reality, that a doctrine
elicits resistance and meets the stroke of natural objection;
and if it only keeps far enough aloft in the metaphysic
atmosphere, it may float along unarrested from zone to zone
of time. Men know not what to make of propositions so
much out of their sphere, so evasive of any real encounter
with their consciousness, and are apt to let them pass for their
very strangeness' sake. But surely we are bound to demand
for them some "response of conscience," and, with Mr. Campbell,
to demur to such of them as will not bear this test. Limiting
ourselves to the <i>mediatorial</i> part of the theory, we will
assume the problem of moral evil to be correctly stated, and
only ask whether, from the supposed case of despair, the
offered solution affords any real exit of relief. Nor do we
assume this for argument's sake alone. We can perfectly
understand any remorseful sense, however deep, of human
unworthiness; any appreciative reverence, however intense,
of Christ's self-sacrifice. Set the one under the shadow of
the Father's infinite disapproval, the other in the light of His
infinite complacency; so far we go; there let them lie. But
what next? Here, on the left hand, is Sin with its need of
punishment; there, on the right, a perfect Holiness with its
merits. While they are thus spread beneath the Father's
eye, they break up their inviolable alliances; each moral
cause crosses over and takes the opposite effect. If such
change took place, the <i>seat</i> of the fact must be sought partly
in the consciousness of Christ, partly in the Father's view of
things. In reference to the first, must we say that the Crucified
<i>felt himself</i> under Divine wrath and punishment, and
esteemed that wrath to be <i>just</i>,&mdash;the fitting expression of his
own inward <i>remorse</i>? If so, can we affirm that his consciousness
was veracious? or did he not feel, in regard to <i>others'</i>
sins, sentiments and experiences that are false except in relation
to <i>one's own</i>? And, ascending to the other point of view,
shall we affirm that the Father <i>saw sin</i> in the Son and was
angry with him; so that, in the hour of sublimest obedience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the words ceased to be true, "Thou art my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased"? And on the other hand, what is
meant when it is said that beneath the Divine eye men in
their guilt are seen "clothed with" a perfect righteousness?
Is such an aspect of them <i>true</i>? or is it akin to an ocular deception?
We seem to be reduced to this dilemma;&mdash;the
change of apparent moral place implied in "imputation" is
either a faithful representation, or a <i>quasi</i>-representation, of
the reality of things. If the latter, then the Divine consciousness
is illusory, and the world is administered on a fiction;
if the former, then the moral law, in assuring us of the
personal and inalienable nature of sin, gives a false report,
and there is nothing to prevent a circulating medium of merit
from passing current through the universe. Mr. Campbell's
deference for the great advocates of this marvellous doctrine
does not obstruct his perception of its difficulties.</p>

<p>"I freely confess," he says, "that to my own mind it is a
relief, not only intellectually, but also morally and spiritually,
to see that there is no foundation for the conceptions that
when Christ suffered for us, the just for the unjust, he suffered
either 'as by imputation unjust,' or 'as if he were unjust.'
I admit that <i>intellectually</i> it is a relief not to be called to conceive
to myself a double consciousness, both in the Father
and in the Son, such as seems implied in the Father's seeing
the Son at one and the same time, though it were but for a
moment, as the well-beloved Son, to whom infinite favor should
go forth, and also as worthy, in respect of the imputation
of our sins to him, of being the object of infinite wrath, he
being the object of such wrath accordingly; and in the Son's
knowing himself the well-beloved of the Father, and yet
having the consciousness of being personally, through imputation
of our sin, the object of the Father's wrath. I feel it
intellectually a relief neither to be called to conceive this, nor
to assume it as an unconceived mystery. Still more do I feel
it <i>morally</i> and <i>spiritually</i> a relief, not to be required to recognize
legal fictions as having a place in this high region, in
which the awful realities of sin and holiness, spiritual death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and spiritual life, are the objects of a transaction between the
Father and the Son in the Eternal Spirit."&mdash;p. 310.</p>

<p>The second form of mediatorial doctrine, to which we have
referred as the modern type of Calvinism, has arisen from the
endeavor to evade some of these perplexities. The riddle
that haunts its teachers is still the same,&mdash;how it can become
possible to show mercy to sinners; but the difficulty in the
way is differently conceived, and therefore met by a different
expedient. It is not an obstacle in God, arising from his personal
sentiment of equity, which must be satisfied; but springs
out of the necessity of consistent rectitude, and adherence to
law in his administrative government. The Father himself,
it is intimated, would be quite willing to forgive, were there
nothing to consult except his own disposition. But it would
never do to play fast and loose with the criminal law of the
universe, and, notwithstanding the most solemn enactments,
let off delinquents on mere repentance, as if nothing were the
matter beyond a personal affront. Something more is due to
<i>Public Justice</i>. If the due course of retribution is to be
turned aside, it must be in such a way and at such a cost as
to proclaim aloud the awfulness of the guilt remitted. This,
we are told, is accomplished by the sufferings and death of the
Son of God, which were substituted for our threatened punishment,
not as its quantitative equal paid to the Father, but
as a moral equivalent in the eyes of men. Their validity is
thus conceived to depend by no means on their particular
measure, but on the meritorious obedience of love which was
their sustaining and animating soul, and which, being on the
scale of a Divine nature, gave infinite value to the smallest
sorrow. Within the casket of his grief was held such a priceless
righteousness, that, on beholding it, the Father might regard
it as an adequate plea for acts of mercy to sinners. He
does not indeed impute to them the actual moral perfectness
of Christ, so as to see them invested with it, any more than
he imputed to Christ their guilt, and frowned on Calvary. It
is the <i>effects</i> only of that holiness which he imputes; he offers
to men the benefits of it, without reckoning it as really theirs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and giving them the <i>legal standing</i> which its possession would
bestow.</p>

<p>No doubt this scheme gets rid of the penal mensuration and
moral conveyancing of the older Calvinism. It shifts also the
bar to free mercy away from the inner personality of God,
and sets it in his outer government. But when we again attempt
to seize the <i>mediatorial expedient</i>, what is it? It is
said to be a display of the enormity of that guilt which needs
to be redeemed at such a cost. But is that need <i>real</i>? Have
we not been told that it has no place in God? Does he then
hang out a profession that is not true to the kernel of things,
but only a show-off for impression's sake? If Eternal Justice
in its inner essence does <i>not</i> require the expiation provided,
why in its outer manifestation pretend that it <i>does</i>? As
nothing can become right for "the sake of good example"
that is not right in itself, so is "Public Justice," unsustained
by the sincere heart of reality, a mere dramatic imposture.
Mr. Campbell has supplied us with a forcible statement of
this truth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely rectoral or public justice, if it is to have any moral
basis,&mdash;any basis other than expediency,&mdash;must rest upon,
and refer to, distributive or absolute justice. In other words,
unless there be a rightness in connecting sin with misery, and
righteousness with blessedness, looking at individual cases
simply in themselves, I cannot see that there is a rightness in
connecting them as a rule of moral government. 'An English
judge once said to a criminal before him: You are condemned
to be transported, not because you have stolen these goods,
but that goods may not be stolen.' (<i>Jenkyns</i>, 175, 176.) This
is quoted in illustration of the position, that 'the death of
Christ is an honorable ground for remitting punishment,' because
'his sufferings answer the same ends as the punishment
of the sinner.' I do not recognize any harmony between this
sentiment of the English judge and the voice of an awakened
conscience on the subject of sin. It is just because he has
sinned and deserves punishment, and not because he says to
himself that God is a moral governor, and must punish him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to deter others, that the wrath of God against sin seems so
terrible,&mdash;and as just as terrible."&mdash;p. 79.</p>

<p>Even were the expression backed up by reality, we cannot
but ask about the fitness of the medium for the thought to be
conveyed. God's horror at guilt is publicly proclaimed by the
most awful crime in human history! To explain the difficulty
of letting off the offender, he exhibits the anguish of the innocent!
The spectacle would seem in danger of suggesting the
wrong lesson to the terrified observer,&mdash;of raising to intensity
the doubt whether, in a world that gives its silver to a Judas,
its judgment-seat to a Pilate, and the cross to the Son of God,
any Providence can care for rectitude at all. Even when
the death of Christ is contemplated exclusively as a <i>self</i>-sacrifice,
without remembering the guilt which compassed it, we
are at a loss to understand how it could be "an honorable
ground for remitting punishment." What difference did it
make in the previous reasons of the Divine government, so
that penalties right before should be less right afterwards?
If Catiline were undergoing his just retribution at the date
of the Last Supper, what plea was there for releasing him at
or before the date of the resurrection? That obedience rendered
and suffering endured by one soul should dispense with
the liabilities of another, is a supposition at variance with the
personal and inalienable nature of all sin; and to say that
God "imputes the <i>effects</i>" of Christ's holiness to those who
are not partakers in the cause, is to accuse the Divine government
of total disregard to character and evasion of moral
reality. The old Calvinism represents the Father as having
an illusory <i>perception</i> of men, <i>as if</i> they were clad in a divine
righteousness. The new Calvinism represents him as having
indeed a true perception of their unrighteousness, but, notwithstanding
this, falsifying the truth <i>in action</i>, and proceeding as
if the facts were quite other than they are. Inasmuch as unveracious
vision is intellectual, while unveracious practice is
moral, the younger doctrine appears to us a positive degradation
of the elder, not only in logical completeness, but in religious
worth. Both of them make the redeeming economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
proceed upon a <i>fiction</i>; but there is all the difference between
unconscious and conscious fiction; between an inner "satisfaction"
brought about by an optical displacement of merit,
and an outward "exhibition" set up for the sake of impression.
The theory of Owen, stern as it is, bears the stamp of
resolute meaning consistently carried through into the inmost
recess of the Divine nature. The newer doctrine is the production
of a platform age, which obtrudes considerations of
<i>effect</i> even into its thoughts of God and his government, and
can scarce refrain from turning the universe itself into a theatre
for rhetorical pathos and <i>ad captandum</i> display.</p>

<p>With good reason, therefore, does our author feel that this
whole subject is in need of reconsideration. His own doctrine
diverges from its predecessors at a very early point, and is
seen at its source in the following proposition of Edwards, as
cited by Mr. Campbell:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In contending that sin must be punished with an infinite
punishment, President Edwards says, 'that God could not be
just to himself without this vindication, unless there could be
such a thing as a repentance, humiliation, and sorrow for this
(viz. sin) proportionable to the greatness of the Majesty despised,'&mdash;for
that there must needs be 'either an equivalent
punishment, or an equivalent sorrow and repentance'; 'so,' he
proceeds, 'sin must be punished with an infinite punishment';
thus assuming that the alternative of 'an equivalent sorrow
and repentance' was out of the question. But, upon the assumption
of that identification of himself with those whom he
came to save, on the part of the Saviour, which is the foundation
of Edwards's whole system, it may at the least be said,
that the Mediator had the two alternatives open to his choice,&mdash;either
to endure for sinners an equivalent punishment, or
to experience in reference to their sin, and present to God on
their behalf, an adequate sorrow and repentance. Either of
these courses should be regarded by Edwards as equally securing
the vindication of the majesty and justice of God in
pardoning sin."&mdash;p. 136.</p>

<p>The side of the alternative which Edwards abandoned, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
author takes up and follows out. The work of Christ, as a
ground of remission, consisted in the offering on behalf of
humanity of an adequate repentance. Adequate it could not
have been but for his Divine nature; which attaches to his
holy sorrow an infinite moral value, to balance the infinite
heinousness of the sin deplored. The only reason why human
penitence does not in itself avail to restore, lies in its imperfect
purity and depth. Through the cloud of evil, and
with the eye of self, we are disqualified for true discernment
of sin as it is: both the limits of a finite nature, and the delusions
of a tempted and fallen one, hinder us from appreciating
the measure of our guilt and misery. Even when our
better mind reasserts itself, our very compunction carries in
it many a speck of ill, and our repentance needs to be repented
of. But were it not for this, there would be "more atoning
worth in one tear of the true and perfect sorrow which
the memory of the past would awaken," "than in endless ages
of penal woe." It is not the inefficacy, but the impossibility,
of due penitence that constitutes our fatal disability; to be relieved
from which we need to be taken out of ourselves, to be
identified with a perfect spirit; our humanity must cease to
be human, and become one with the Divine nature. This is
precisely the condition which realized itself in Christ. As
God in humanity, he had perfect sympathy with the holiness
of one sphere, and the infirmities of the other; he saw the
whole amount of the world's moral estrangement, not only
with infinite pity for its misery, but with infinite horror at its
guilt. He could both make a plenary confession for us, and
respond unreservedly to the Father's righteous judgment;
could bear our burden on his heart before heaven, and utter
the <i>Miserere</i> of holy sorrow, which our most plaintive cry can
never approach. This is the true nature of his sufferings.
He "made his soul an offering for sin," yielded it up to be
filled with a sense of our real aspect beneath the Omniscient
eye, and an Amen to its condemning look. Hence his sorrows
had nothing <i>penal</i> in them, any more than the tears of a
devout parent over a prodigal child are penal. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
incident to that attitude of soul which a perfect nature cannot
but have in the presence of a brother's sin. They are altogether
moral and spiritual; and their efficacy as an expiation
is that of true repentance; expressing at once our entire confession,
acceptance of the Father's just displeasure, and sympathy
with his compassionate grieving at our alienation.</p>

<p>At the same time, this mere retrospective confession would
not of itself avail, were there no better hope for the future of
mankind. But our Mediator's own experience in humanity,
his consciousness of intimate peace and communion with the
Father, opened to him the other side of our nature, assured
him of its secret capacity for good, and filled him with hope
in the very moment of contrition. As his sympathy could
have fellowship with our temptations, so could ours have fellowship
with his righteousness; and the light of Divine love
that rested actually on himself was thereby a possibility for
the universal human soul, and was already hovering round
with longing to descend. It was on the strength of this assurance
that his intercession on our behalf was presented; it
would never have pleaded for indemnity in relation to the
past, but as the prelude to a real righteousness, a true partnership
in his life of filial harmony with God. The validity of
his transaction on our behalf consisted in its perfect seizure
of the whole reality, its entire "response to the mind of the
Father in relation to men"; sorrow for their estrangement,
conviction of their possible return, and desire to draw them
into the spirit of genuine Sonship.</p>

<p>It was needful, then,&mdash;so we conceive our author's meaning,&mdash;that
the sentiments of God towards the world's sin and
misery should quit their absolute position, and should come
and take their station in humanity; and from that field should
turn their gaze and expression upward to meet the Father's
downward and accordant look. As this "Amen of the Son
to the mind of the Father" constitutes the essence of the
atonement on the Divine side, so does it consist on the human
side in "the Amen of each individual soul to the Amen of
the Son." The reproduction in us of the filial spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Christ,&mdash;his confession, his pleading, his trust,&mdash;is our fellowship
with him and reconciliation with God.</p>

<p>"This is saving faith,&mdash;true righteousness,&mdash;being the
living action, and true and right movement of the spirit of the
individual man in the light of eternal life. And the certainty
that God has accepted that perfect and divine Amen as uttered
by Christ in humanity is necessarily accompanied by
the peaceful assurance that, in uttering, in whatever feebleness,
a true Amen to that high Amen, the individual who is
yielding himself to the spirit of Christ to have it uttered in
him is accepted of God. This Amen in man is the due
response to that word, 'Be ye reconciled to God'; for the
gracious and Gospel character of which word, as the tenderest
pleading that can be addressed to the most sin-burdened spirit,
I have contended above. This Amen is sonship; for the Gospel
call, 'Be ye reconciled to God,' when heard in the light
of the knowledge that 'God made him to be sin for us who
knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him,' is understood to be the call to each one of us on the
part of the Father of our spirits, 'My son, give me thine
heart,' addressed to us on the ground of that work by which
the Son had declared the Father's name, that the love wherewith
the Father hath loved him may be in us, and he in us.
In the light itself of that Amen to the mind of the Father in
relation to man which shines to us in the atonement, we see
the <i>righteousness of God in accepting the atonement</i>, and in
that same light the Amen of the individual human spirit to
that divine Amen of the Son of God is seen to be what the
Divine righteousness will necessarily acknowledge as the <i>end
of the atonement accomplished</i>."&mdash;p. 225.</p>

<p>In this view, it is not the rescue from punishment, not any
favorable change in our legal standing, not any imputed righteousness,
that Christ's mediation obtains, but a real transformation
of soul and character through the divine infection and
infusion of his own filial spirit. Only in so far as his mind
thus spreads to us are we united to him, or in any way partakers
of his gift of life. Personal alienation can have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
reversal but in personal return; nor can anything "extraneous
to the nature of the Divine will itself, to which we are
to be reconciled, have part in reconciling us to that will."
The fear of hell is not repentance; the assurance of heaven
is not salvation; nor under any modification can the desire
of safety, or the consciousness of its attainment, constitute the
least approach to holiness. The good alone can touch the
springs of goodness; and the divine and trustful life of Christ
must speak to us on its own account, and win us by its own
power, or not at all. Not that it acts on us merely in the
way of <i>example</i>. We do not so stand apart from him in our
independent individuality, that by an external imitation we
can copy him, and become, as it were, each another Christ,
repeating in ourselves his offering of propitiation. He is the
Vine, of which we are the branches. The sap is from him,
drawn through the eternal root of righteousness, and does but
flow as a derived life into us. The Son of God is not a mere
historical personage, to be contemplated at a distance in the
past, but ever with us in the power of an endless life; still
succoring us when we are tempted, and ministering to conscience
a present help and peace. It is not, therefore, by
<i>following</i> him, but by <i>abiding in</i> him, that we have our fellowship
in his harmony with God.</p>

<p>The essence, then, of the scheme of redemption, in the
view of our author, seems to be this: that the Divine nature
entered humanity to open the Fatherliness of God by living
the life of perfect Sonship; and that, having awakened that
life in us by this its visible realization, he sustains it by the
inner presence of his Spirit. It is one of the obvious consequences
of this doctrine, that no exclusive or exceptional value
is to be ascribed to the <i>death</i> of Christ. It is simply the final
and crowning expression of the same filial mind which is the
continuous essence of his whole existence upon earth. Nor
does the theory attach importance to any <i>sufferings</i> of Christ,
as such; but only as media and measures of moral expression.
Had men sinned <i>as spirits</i>, his reconciling work would not
have involved death at all: but since in our constitution mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
is "the wages of sin," his response to the Divine mind
in regard to sin would have been incomplete, had he not
honored this law and tasted its realization. Not to lose sight
of the main features of the doctrine in pursuit of details, we
must pass without notice many curious and subtle thoughts of
our author on this part of his subject. Indeed, everywhere
the reader who has patience with the entangled style will find
deep hints and delicate turns of reflection. But we must
withdraw to a little distance from his system, and endeavor to
look at it as a whole; fixing attention especially on the central
point of all,&mdash;the <i>mediatorial provision</i>, which replaces the
penal "satisfaction" of the elder Calvinism, and the "exhibition
of rectoral justice" of the modern divines.</p>

<p>Instead of an infinite punishment endured or represented,
the theory offers us an infinite <i>repentance</i> performed. Repentance
for what?&mdash;for human sin. Repentance by whom?&mdash;by
Him "who knew no sin." Is this a thing that can be? Is
vicarious contrition at all more conceivable than vicarious
retribution? It is surely one and the same difficulty that
meets them both. On what ground is the transfer of either
moral qualities or their effects regarded by our author as
impossible?&mdash;because at variance with our consciousness of
the personal and inalienable nature of sin. But not less is
this truth contradicted when we say that the guilt may be
incurred by one person, and the availing repentance take
place in another. Nor can any imagination of Christ's state
of mind identify it with penitence. Mr. Campbell himself
describes it (p. 135) as having "all the elements of a perfect
repentance in humanity for all the sin of man&mdash;a perfect
sorrow&mdash;a perfect contrition,&mdash;all the elements of such a
repentance, and that in absolute perfection&mdash;all&mdash;<i>excepting
the personal consciousness of sin</i>." This exception, however,
contains just the essential element of the whole. Penitence
without any personal consciousness of sin is a contradiction in
terms; and the requisition of the Divine law is, that <i>the sinner</i>
shall turn from the evil of his heart, not that the righteous
shall make confession for him. The entire moral value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
contrition belongs to it as the sign of inner change of character
from prior evil to succeeding good; and it admits of no
transplantation from the identical personality which has been
the seat of the evil and is the candidate for the good.</p>

<p>Further, it seems a paradox to say, with our author, that
true repentance is impossible to man, who alone needs it; and
can be realized only by the Son of God, in whom there is no
room for it. It would indeed be a hopeless realm to live in,
which should annex to all sins both an imperative demand
and an absolute disqualification for adequate contrition, and first
open the fountain of availing tears in holy natures that have
none to shed. It is, in truth, of the very essence of repentance
to have its seat in mixed and imperfect moral beings:
and our author lays upon it quite an arbitrary requisition,
when he insists that, to pass as adequate, it must contain a
perfect appreciation of the sin deplored,&mdash;a view of it coincident
with that of God. Under such an aspect as this it could
never have appeared to us, though we had remained guiltless
of it, and recoiled from it: and we can hardly be required to
reach, in the rebound of recovery, a point beyond the station
which would have prevented the fall. Many errors in theology
arise from applying absolute conceptions to relative conditions,
and forgetting that religion, as realized in us, is a life,
a movement, a progress, and not an ultimate limit of perfection.
Repentance is a transitional state, to which it is absurd
to apply an infinite criterion: it is a change from the worse to
the better mind, and cannot need the resources or belong to
the experience of the best. To pronounce it impossible to
the wandering and fallen, and make it the exclusive function
of the All-holy, implies the strangest metamorphosis of its
meaning.</p>

<p>But how, it may be asked, could a paradox so violent find
favor with an author everywhere intent on the exclusion of
fiction from Christian theology? To refer a moral act to
the <i>wrong personality</i>, to toss about a solemn change like
penitence between guilty and innocent, as if its particular seat
were a matter of indifference, is so serious an error, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
could never enter a mind like Mr. Campbell's, unless under
some plausible disguise. Can we find the shape under which
it has recommended itself to his approval?</p>

<p>The sentiment ascribed to the Son of God in regard to
sin,&mdash;wanting as it does the essential penitential element of
personal compunction,&mdash;is simple sorrow for others' guilt,
founded on perfect apprehension of its nature. But this
attitude of soul in him awakens the conscience of his disciples,
and is reproduced in them by fellowship. Spread into
their consciousness, it is no longer clear of the immediate
presence of sin, but, falling in with it, assumes the missing
element, and becomes repentance. When the Christian sense
of evil, which ever partakes of true contrition, is thus contemplated
as a transmigration of the Mediator's own spirit into
the soul, the two are so identified in thought, that what is true
only of the human effect is referred to the Divine cause; and
the moral sorrow of Christ is regarded as <i>potentially</i> equivalent
to repentance, because that is <i>actually</i> the form of the
corresponding phenomenon in us. If this, however, <i>explains</i>
our author's position, it hardly <i>justifies</i> it. Intercession for
others in their guilt may <i>move them</i> to remorse for their own,
but is a fact of quite different nature. As attributes and expressions
of character, the two phenomena are not to be confounded;
and as affecting our relation to God, there is the
obvious and admitted distinction, that intercession avails not
for those who remain impenitent, and would not be needed for
the spontaneously penitent. The sorrowful expostulations
of the Son of God have only so far a reconciling effect as
they become the medium, in the hearts of men, of an awakened
contrition, aspiration, and faith. We cannot conceive
them to have <i>immediately</i> altered&mdash;as repentance <i>does</i>&mdash;the
personal relation between God and the transgressors of
His will; else the change would be a change in the Divine
sentiment whilst its objects still remained unchanged. The
effect <i>waits</i> for its development in souls melted and renewed.
And thus the atoning sorrow of Christ becomes simply a
provision for a healing penitence in men.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The ascription of "repentance" to Christ is curious in
another point of view. It arises from a blending together of
<i>his</i> consciousness and <i>his disciples'</i>; from slurring the lines of
personality between them; from regarding their spiritual
state as an organic extension of his, and his as the vital root
of theirs. In his endeavor to recommend it to us, our author
instinctively runs into abstract expressions in speaking of
mankind; fusing down concrete men into "<i>humanity</i>"; referring
to the Mediator as "God in <i>humanity</i>"; and so, dealing
with our nature as if it were a single existence, carrying
or turning up all its individuals as partial phenomena of one
essence. On the other hand, in our endeavor to correct his
doctrine, we have had to lay stress on the inalienable and
separate character of all particular persons, taken one by
one; to insist on the solitude of each responsible agent, and
the impassable barriers which forbid the transference of moral
attributes from mind to mind. Which of these two modes of
conception is the truer? For according as we incline to the
one or the other,&mdash;according as we treat <i>humanity</i> as the
organic unit of which individual samples of mankind are numerical
accidents, or take each man as an integer, of which
the race is a multiple,&mdash;shall we lean towards mediatorial
or towards direct religion. We are firmly convinced that <i>no</i>
doctrine of <i>mediation</i>&mdash;in the strict sense implying transactions
with God on behalf of men, <i>as well as</i> in the opposite
direction&mdash;can be harmonized with the modern <i>individualism</i>;
and that it is precisely in the attempt to unite these incompatibles,
that the forensic fictions to which Mr. Campbell
objects, and the moral fiction in his own theory to which we
object, have had their origin. They are mere artificial devices
to compensate the loss of that realistic mode of conception in
which alone a true atoning doctrine can rest in peace. So
long as you contemplate the Redeemer as a detached person,
not less insulated in his integrity of being than angel from
archangel or from man, the difficulty will remain insuperable
of making his moral acts avail for <i>other human individuals</i>,
unless by a fictitious transference, against which conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
protests. Punishment by substitute, righteousness by deputy,
vicarious repentance, are notions at variance with the fundamental
postulates of the Moral Sense: and in the attempt to
defend them we are liable to lose the solemn, living, face-to-face
reality of the strife within us, and to weave around us a
web of legal and formal relations, as little like any heart-felt
veracity as a chancery decree to a law of nature. In proportion
as the soul is pierced with a sharper contrition, and
attains a deeper and clearer insight into her own unfaithful disorder,
will the inherent impossibility of any foreign exchange
of righteousness become apparent, and the desire to be shielded
from punishment will pass away: nor is the conscience truly
awakened which does not rather rush into the arms of its just
anguish than start back and fly away. And the more you
hold up to view the holiness of Christ, the darker will the
personal past appear to grow; for self-reproach will say:
"Yes, I see him as the holy Son of God; the guiltier am I
that the vision did not keep me from my sin." Talk to such
a one of Christ's transactions on our behalf, as "<i>federal head</i>"
of a redeemed people; and his misery will take no notice of
the cold pretence, unless to think, "Whatever engagements
he made for me, I have broken them all." In short, while
Christ is regarded simply as an historical individual, with the
chasm of an incommunicable personality between him and us,
no ingenuity can construct, except from the ruins of moral
law, any other bridge of mediation than the suasion of natural
reverence, by which his image passes into the heart of faith.</p>

<p>It is otherwise when we break through the restraints of the
modern individualism, and strive to enter into that literal
identification of Christ with Christians which is so frequent
with St. Paul. If, instead of saying that Christ <i>had</i> our
human nature, we could put our thought into this form,&mdash;"He
<i>was</i> (and <i>is</i>) our human nature,"&mdash;if we could suppose
our type of being not merely represented in him as a sample,
but concentrated in him as a whole,&mdash;we should read its
essentials and destination in his biography: his predicates
would be its predicates: and in his sorrows and sanctity it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
might undergo purification. Humanity thus made into a
person would then be the corresponding fact to Deity embodied
in a person: both would be <i>Incarnations</i>,&mdash;essential
Manhood and essential Godhead,&mdash;co-present in the same
manifested life. In the ordinary conception of the doctrine
of two natures, Christ is represented, we believe, as <i>a</i> man;
in the mode of thought to which we now refer, he appears as
<i>Man</i>. The difficulties which arise in the attempt to carry out
this form of thinking are evident enough, even to those who
know nothing of the Parmenides of Plato. Indeed, they are
rendered so obtrusive by our modern habits of mind, that
even a momentary seizure, for mere purposes of interpretation,
of that older intellectual posture, scarcely remains possible
to us. The apprehension of it, however, is indispensable
to one who would appreciate the mediatorial theology of
Christendom,&mdash;a theology which never could have sprung up
if our present conceptualist and nominalist notions had always
prevailed, and which, ever since their ascendency in Europe,
has been driven to deplorable shifts of self-justification. The
parallel between the first and second Adam, the fall and the
restoration, the death incurred and the life recovered, acquire
new meaning for those who thus think,&mdash;that as the incidents
of Adam's existence become <i>generic</i> by <i>descent</i>, so the incidents
of Christ's existence are generic by <i>diffusion</i>; that if
in the one we see humanity at head-quarters in <i>time</i>, in the
other we see it at head-quarters in <i>comprehension</i>; so that,
like an atmosphere which, purified at nucleus, has the taint
drawn off from its margin, our nature is freed from its sickliness
in him. It becomes intelligible to us in what sense we
are to take refuge in him as our including term, to find in
him an epitome of our true existence, to die (even to have
died) with him, to suffer with him, to be risen with him, to
dwell above in him. On the assumption of such a union, his
life ceases to be an individual biography; what is manifested
in him personally, becomes true of us universally; and it is as
if we were all&mdash;like special examples in a general rule, or
undeveloped truths in a parent principle&mdash;virtually present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
in his dealings with evil and with God. It is evident, that in
this view his mediation has no chasm to cross, no foreign
region to enter, but is an inseparable predicate of his own
personal acts. The facility of conception afforded by this
method is betrayed by Mr. Campbell's resort to an analogous
hypothesis as a mere illustrative help to the mind. Witness
the following striking passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That we may fully realize what manner of equivalent to
the dishonor done to the law and name of God by sin an
adequate repentance and sorrow for sin must be, and how far
more truly than any penal infliction such repentance and confession
must satisfy Divine justice, let us suppose that all the
sin of humanity has been committed by one human spirit, on
whom is accumulated this immeasurable amount of guilt; and
let us suppose this spirit, loaded with all this guilt, to pass out
of sin into holiness, and to become filled with the light of God,
becoming perfectly righteous with God's own righteousness,&mdash;such
a change, were such a change possible, would imply in
the spirit so changed a perfect condemnation of the past of its
own existence, and an absolute and perfect repentance, a confession
of its sin commensurate with its evil. If the sense of
personal identity remained, it must be so. Now, let us contemplate
this repentance with reference to the guilt of such a
spirit, and the question of pardon for its past sin and admission
now to the light of God's favor. Shall this repentance
be accepted as an atonement, and, the past sin being thus confessed,
shall the Divine favor flow out on that present perfect
righteousness which thus condemns the past, or shall that
repentance be declared inadequate? Shall the present perfect
righteousness be rejected on account of the past sin, so absolutely
and perfectly repented of? and shall Divine justice still
demand adequate punishment for the past sin, and refuse to
the present righteousness adequate acknowledgment,&mdash;the
favor which, in respect of its own nature, belongs to it? It
appears to me impossible to give any but one answer to these
questions. We feel that such a repentance as we are supposing
would, in such a case, be the true and proper satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to offended justice. Now, with the difference of personal
identity, the case I have supposed is the actual case of Christ,
the holy one of God, bearing the sins of all men on his spirit,&mdash;in
Luther's words, 'the one sinner,'&mdash;and meeting the cry
of these sins for judgment, and the wrath due to them, absorbing
and exhausting that Divine wrath in that adequate confession
and perfect response on the part of man which was
possible only to the infinite and eternal righteousness in humanity."&mdash;p.
143.</p>

<p>The case which our author here presents as an aid to the
imagination was to Luther the literal reality; to whom, accordingly,
Christ was "the one sinner," <i>without</i> "the difference
of personal identity," which is here so innocently slipped
in, as if it were of no consequence. Christ, in the Reformer's
view, <i>was</i> humanity, <i>our</i> humanity; and the grand function
and triumph of faith is to feel ourselves included in him, to
merge our individuality, sins and all, in his comprehending
manhood and atoning obedience. Hence the stress which
Luther lays on "the well-applying the pronoun" <i>our</i>, in the
phrase, "who gave himself for our sins"; "that this one
syllable being believed may swallow up all thy sins." The
effect of this realism on the theology of Luther has not been
sufficiently remarked. We believe it to be the key to much
that is obscure in his writings, and the secret source of his
antipathy to the Calvinistic type of the Reformation. Absorption
of Manhood into Christ,&mdash;distribution of Godhead
into humanity,&mdash;these were the correlative parts of his objective
belief,&mdash;Atonement and Eucharistic Real Presence: and
neither in themselves nor in their correspondence can they be
appreciated, without standing with him at the point of view
which we have endeavored to indicate.</p>

<p>Whether mediatorial religion shall continue to include in its
scheme some provision for <i>dealing with God on behalf of men</i>,
will mainly depend on the successful revival or the final abandonment
of the old realistic modes of thought. Mr. Campbell's
compromise with them, taking refuge with them for
illustration while disowning them in substance, answers no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
logical or theological purpose at all. If he follows out the
natural tendencies and affinities of his faith, he must rest
exclusively at last in the other half of the doctrine, which
exhibits the <i>dealing with man on behalf of God</i>. In this best
sense mediatorial religion is imperishable, and imperishably
identified with Christianity. The Son of God, at once above
our life and in our life, morally divine and circumstantially
human, mediates for us between the self so hard to escape,
and the Infinite so hopeless to reach; and draws us out of our
mournful darkness without losing us in excess of light. He
opens to us the moral and spiritual mysteries of our existence,
appealing to a consciousness in us that was asleep before.
And though he leaves whole worlds of thought approachable
only by silent wonder, yet his own walk of heavenly communion,
his words of grace and works of power, his strife of
divine sorrow, his cross of self-sacrifice, his reappearance
behind the veil of life eternal, fix on him such holy trust and
love, that, where we are denied the assurance of knowledge,
we attain the repose of faith.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="FIVE_POINTS_OF_CHRISTIAN_FAITH" id="FIVE_POINTS_OF_CHRISTIAN_FAITH">FIVE POINTS OF CHRISTIAN FAITH.</a></h2>


<p>It is at all times difficult, even for the wisest, to describe
aright the tendencies of the age in which they live, and lay
down its bearings on the great chart of human affairs. Our
own sensations can give us no notice whither we are going;
and the infinite life-stream on which we ride, restless as it is
with the surface-waves of innumerable events, reports nothing
of the mighty current that sweeps us on, except by faint
and silent intimations legible only to the skilled interpreter of
heaven. It is something, however, to have the feeling <i>that
we are moving</i>, and to be awake and looking out; and perhaps
there never was a period in which this consciousness was
more diffused throughout society than in our own. No one
can look up and around at the religious and social phenomena
of Christendom, without the persuasion that we are entering
a new hemisphere of the world's history,&mdash;a persuasion corroborated
even by those who disclaim it, and who insist on
still steering by lights of tradition now sinking into the mists
of the receding horizon. Wherever we turn our eye, we discover
some symptom of an impending revolution in the forms
of Christian faith. The gross materialism and absolute unbelief
diffused for the first time among vast masses of our population;
the fast-spreading (and, as it appears to us, morbid)
dislike to look steadily at anything miraculous; the extensive
renunciation, even among the religious classes on the Continent,
of historical Christianity; the schisms and ever-new peculiarities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
which are weakening all sects, and, like seedlings of the
Reformation, are obscuring the species, by multiplying the varieties,
of opinion; the revived controversies, penetrating all
the great political questions of the age, between the ecclesiastical
and civil powers,&mdash;are not the only indications of
approaching theological change. That very conservatism
and recoil upon the high doctrine of an elder time, which is
manifest in every section of the Christian world, is a confession
by contrast of the same thing. For opinion does not
turn round and retreat into the past, till it has lost its natural
shelter in the present, and dreads some merciless storm in the
future. The outward strength which the older churches of
our country seem to be acquiring arises from the rallying of
alarm and the herding together of trembling sympathies; and
though fear may unite men against external assaults upon institutions,
it cannot stop the decay of inward doubt. It would
seem as if Christianity was threatened by the mental activity
which it has itself created; as if the intellectual weapons
which have been forged and tempered by its skill were treacherously
turned against its life. It is vain, however, to strike
a power that is immortal; nothing will fall but the bodily
form cast for a season around the imperishable spirit.</p>

<p>Protestantism, with all its blessings, has after all greatly
disfigured Christianity, by constructing it into a rigid metaphysical
form, and setting it up on a narrow pedestal of antiquarian
proof;&mdash;by destroying its infinite character through
definitions, and developing it dogmatically rather than spiritually;&mdash;by
treating it, not as an ideal glory around the life of
man, but a logical incision into the psychology of God. The
wreck of systems framed under this false conception will but
leave the pure spirit of our religion in the enjoyment of a
more sacred homage;&mdash;you may dash the image, but you
cannot touch the god.</p>

<p>In the following remarks we shall seek to make this evident;&mdash;to
show what principles of religion in general, and of
Christianity in particular, may be pronounced safe from the
shocks of doubt. In times of consternation and uncertainty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it behooves each one to look within him for the heart of courage,
and around him for the place of shelter, and to single
out, amid countless points of danger, some refuge immutable
and eternal. With this view, we propose to trace an outline
of Christian truths which we consider secure and durable as
our very nature;&mdash;a chain of granite points rising, like the
rock of ages, above the shifting seas of human opinion. In
doing so, we shall be simply delineating Unitarian Christianity,
according to our conception of it;&mdash;expounding it, not as
a barren negation, but as a scheme of positive religion; exhibiting
both its characteristic faiths, and something of the
modes of thought by which they are reached.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I. In the <i>first</i> place, <span class="smcap">We have faith</span> in the <i>Moral Perceptions
of Man</i>. The conscience with which he is endowed
enables him to appreciate the distinction between right and
wrong; to understand the meaning of "<i>ought</i>," and "<i>ought
not</i>"; to love and revere whatever is great and excellent in
character, to abhor the mean and base; and to feel that in the
contrast between these we have the highest order of differences
by which mind can be separated from mind. And on this
consciousness,&mdash;the basis of our whole responsible existence,&mdash;no
suspicion is to be cast; no lamentation over its fallibility,
no hint of possible delusion, is to pass unrebuked; it is
worthy of absolute reliance as the authoritative oracle of our
nature, supreme over all its faculties,&mdash;entitled to use sense,
memory, understanding, to register its decrees, without a moment's
license to dispute them. That Justice, Mercy, and
Truth are good and venerable, is no matter of doubtful opinion,
in which peradventure an error may be hid;&mdash;is not
even a thing of certain inference, recommended to us by the
force of evidence;&mdash;is not an empirical judgment, depending
on the pleasurableness of these qualities, and capable of reversal,
if, under some tyrant sway, they were to be rendered
sources of misery. The approval which we award to them is
quite distinct from assent to a scientific probability; the excellence
which we ascribe to them is not identical with their
command of happiness, but altogether transcends this, precedes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
it, and survives it; the obligation they lay upon us is
not the consequence of positive law, human or divine, or in
any way the creature of superior will; for all free-will must
itself possess a moral quality,&mdash;can never stir without exercising
it,&mdash;and cannot therefore give rise to that which is a
prior condition of its own activity. And if (to pursue the
thought suggested above) we could be snatched away to some
distant world, some out-province of the universe, abandoned
by God's blessed sway to the absolutism of demons, where
selfishness and sensuality, and hate and falsehood, were protected
and enjoined by public law, it is clear that, by such
emigration, our interests only, and not our duties, would be
reversed; and that to rebel and perish were nobler than to
comply and live. The discernment of moral distinctions,
then, belongs to the very highest order of certainties; it has
its seat in our deepest reason, among the primitive strata of
thought, on which the depositions of knowledge, and the accumulations
of judgment, and the surface growths of opinion, all
repose. As experience in the past has not taught it, experience
in the future cannot <i>unteach</i> it. The difference between
good and evil we cannot conceive to be merely relative, and
incidental to our point of view,&mdash;variable with the locality
and the class in which a being happens to rest,&mdash;an optical
caprice of the atmosphere in which we live;&mdash;but rather a
property of the very light itself, found everywhere out of the
region of absolute night; or, at least, a natural impression,
belonging to that perceptive eye of the soul, through which
alone we can look out, as through a glass, upon all beings and
all worlds; and if any one will say that the glass is colored, it
is, at all events, the tint of nature, shed on it by the ineffaceable
art of the Creator. The modes in which we think of
moral qualities are not terrestrial peculiarities of idea, like
foreign prejudices; the terms in which we speak of them are
not untranslatable provincial idioms, vulgarities of our planetary
dialect, but are familiar, like the symbols of a divine
science, to every tribe of souls, belonging to the language of
the universe, and standing defined in the vocabulary of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
The laws of right are more necessarily universal than the
physical laws of force; and if the same agency of gravitation
that governs the rain-drop determines the evolutions of the
sky, and the Principia of Newton would be no less intelligible
and true on the ring of Saturn than in the libraries of this
earth,&mdash;yet more certain is it that the principles of moral
excellence, truly expounded for the smallest sphere of responsibility,
hold good, by mere extension, for the largest, and that
those sentiments of conscience which may give order and
beauty to the life of a child, constitute the blessedness of
immortals, and penetrate the administration of God. This is
what we intend, when we insist on implicit faith in the moral
perceptions of man. They are to be assumed by us as the
fixed station, the grand heliocentric position, whence our survey
of the spiritual universe must be made, and our system
of religion constructed. Whatever else may move, here, as
in creation's centre of gravity, we take our everlasting stand.
Whatever else be doubtful, these are to be simply trusted.
The force of certainty by which nature and God give them to
the conscience exceeds any by which, either through the understanding
or through external supernatural communication,
they might <i>seem</i> to be drawn away. No revelation could persuade
me that what I revere as just, and good, and holy, is
<i>not venerable</i>, any more than it could convince me that the
midnight heavens are not sublime.</p>

<p>There is nothing to move us from this position, in the objection,
that different men have different ideas of right and
wrong, and that the heroic deeds of one latitude are regarded
as the crimes of another. This moral discrepancy is, in the
first place, infinitely small in proportion to the moral agreement
of mankind, so that it is even difficult to find many
striking examples of it; and when the subject is mentioned,
everybody expects to hear the self-immolation of the Indian
widow, and other superstitions of the Ganges, adduced as the
standing illustrations. What, after all, are these eccentricities
of the moral sense, compared with the scale of its common
consent? As well might you deny the existence of an atmosphere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
because you have found the air exhausted from a
pump! Where is the nation or the individual, without the rudiments,
however imperfectly unfolded, of the same great ideas
of duty which we possess ourselves?&mdash;where the language,
in which there are no terms to denote good and evil,&mdash;the
just, the brave, the merciful?&mdash;where the tribe so barbarous
as not to listen, with earnest eye, to the story of the good
Samaritan? And if such there were, should we not call
them a people but little human (<i>inhuman</i>), and deem them,
not the specimens, but the outlaws of our nature? Moreover,
the variances of moral judgment are usually only apparent
and external. The action which one man pronounces wrong
and another right, is not the same, except upon the lips:
enter the minds of the two disputants, and you will find that
it is only half taken into the view of each, and presents to
them its opposite hemispheres; no wonder that it shows the
darkness of guilt to the one, and the sunshine of virtue to the
other. And accordingly, these differences actually vanish as
the faculty of conscience unfolds itself, and the scope of the
mind is enlarged. Like the discrepancies in the ideas which
men have of beauty, they exist principally between the uncultivated
and the refined: and the well-developed perceptions
of the best in all ages and countries visibly agree. Nay,
while yet the discordance lasts, it introduces no real doubt:
for heaven has established a moral subordination among men,
which reveals the real truth of our own nature. Do we not
always see, that the lower conscience bows before the higher;&mdash;that
the heart, without light or heat itself, may be pierced,
as with a flash, by a sentiment darted from a loftier soul, and
own it to be from above;&mdash;that, simply by this natural
allegiance of the lesser to the nobler, classes and nations
and sects are raised in dignity and moral greatness;&mdash;that
they, and they only, have had any grand and sublime existence
in the history of the world, who have been gifted with
power to create a new religion,&mdash;a fresh development of
what is holy and divine;&mdash;and that every one so endowed
has always gathered around him the multitudes ever praying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to be lifted above the level of their life, and blessing the
benefactor who wakes up the consciousness of their higher
nature? And if so, the general <i>direction</i> of the moral sentiment
is the same, however its intensity may vary: and the
irregular indications which it gives are not due to any inherent
vacillation, but to the disturbing causes which deflect it from
the celestial line of simplicity and truth.</p>

<p>We keep our foot, then, on this primitive foundation,&mdash;faith
in the moral perceptions of man. We say, that we
know what we mean, when we affirm that a being is just,
pure, disinterested, merciful; that these terms describe one
particular kind of character, and one only; that they have
the same sense to whomsoever they are applied, and are not
to be juggled with, so as to denote quite opposite forms of
action and disposition, according as our discourse may be of
heaven or of earth; that whenever they lose their ordinary
and intelligible signification, they become senseless; and that
what would be wrong and odious in any one moral agent,
can be, under similar relations, right and lovely in no
other. These positions, which we take to be fundamental,
are in direct contradiction to the theological maxims with
which most churches begin;&mdash;viz. that human nature is so
depraved that its conscience has lost its discernment, sees
everything through a corrupted medium, and deserves no
trust; that it may surrender its convictions to anything
which can bring fair historical evidence of its being a revelation;&mdash;in
other words, that it may be right to throw away
our ideas of right, and, in obedience to antiquarian witnesses,
suppose it holy in God to design and execute a scheme
which it would be a crime in man to imitate. These principles
are defended by the assertion, that the relations of
the Divine and the human being are so different as to destroy
all the analogies of character between them. The only
tendency, both of this defence and of the principles themselves,
is to absolute scepticism;&mdash;to <i>atheistical scepticism</i>,
inasmuch as our propositions respecting God, if not true in
the plain human sense, are to us true in no other, and represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<i>nothing</i>; to <i>moral scepticism</i>, inasmuch as, the sentiments
of conscience being exposed to distrust, and all its language
rendered unsettled, the very ground on which human character
must plant itself is loosened; the rock of duty melts
into water beneath our feet, and we are cast into the waves
of impulse and caprice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. We have Faith in the <i>Moral Perfection of God</i>. This
indeed is a plain consequence of our reliance on the natural
sentiments of duty. For it is not, we apprehend, by our
logical, but by our moral faculty, that we have our knowledge
of God; and he who most confides in the instructor will learn
the sacred lesson best. That one whom we may call the
Holiest rules the universe, is no discovery made by the intellect
in its excursions, but a revelation found by the conscience
on retiring into itself; and though we may reason
in defence of this great truth, and these reasonings, when
constructed, may look convincing enough, they are not, we
conceive, the source, but rather the effect, of our belief,&mdash;not
the forethought which actually precedes and introduces
the Faith, but the afterthought by which Faith seeks to make
a friend and an intimate of the understanding. Does any
one hesitate to admit this, and think that our conceptions
of the Divine character are inferences regularly drawn from
observation,&mdash;not indeed observation on the mere physical
arrangements, but on the moral phenomena, of our world,&mdash;from
the traces of a regard to character in the administration
of human life? We will not at present dispute the conclusion;
but, observing that the premises which furnish it are
certain <i>moral</i> experiences, we remark that the very power of
receiving and appreciating these, of knowing what they are
worth, belongs not to our scientific faculty, but to our sense of
justice and of right. On a being destitute of this they would
make no impression; and in precise proportion to the intensity
of this feeling will be the vividness and force of their persuasion.
And is it not plain <i>in fact</i>, that it is far from being
the clear and acute intellect, but rather the pure and transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
heart, that best discerns God? How many strong and
sagacious judgments, of coolest capacity for the just estimate
of argument, never attain to any deep conviction of a perfect
Deity! Nay, how much does scepticism on this great matter
seem to be proportioned, not to the obtuseness, but rather to
the subtlety and searchingness of the mere understanding?
But when was it ever known that the singularly pure and
simple heart, the earnest and aspiring conscience, the lofty
and disinterested soul, had no faith in the "First fair and
the First good"? Philosophy at its ease, apart from the
real responsibilities and strong battle of life, loses its diviner
sympathies, and lapses into the scrupulosity of doubt, and
from the centre of comfort weeps over the miseries of earth,
and the questionable benevolence of heaven; while the practically
tried and struggling, with moral force growing beneath
the pressure of crushing toil, look up with a refreshing trust,
and with worn and bleeding feet pant happily along to the
abodes of everlasting love. The moral victor, flushed with
triumph over temptation, feels that God is on his side, and
that the spirit of the universe is in sympathy with his joy.
Never did any one spend himself in the service of man, and
yet despair of the benignity of God. Our faith, then, in the
Divine perfection, forms and disengages itself from the deeps
of conscience: and the Holiest that broods over us solemnly
rises&mdash;the awful spirit of eternity&mdash;from the ocean of our
moral nature.</p>

<p>It is in conformity with this doctrine of the <i>moral</i> origin
of our belief in the first principles of religion, that to every
man his God is <i>his best and highest</i>, the embodiment of that
which the believer himself conceives to be the greatest. The
image which he forms of that Being may indeed be gross and
terrible; and others may be shocked, and exclaim that he
trusts, not in a Divinity, but in a Fiend: but will the worshipper
himself perceive and acknowledge this?&mdash;will he not
indignantly deny it?&mdash;will he not eagerly vindicate the perfection
of the Deity he serves? He can do no otherwise; for
he discerns nothing more sublime, and cannot be convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that <i>that</i> is low which stands at the summit of his thoughts.
This uniform phenomenon in the history of religion could
not exist, if human faith were an inference of intellectual
origin. There would be nothing <i>then</i> to prevent some men,
in their reasonings on the probable character of God, from
assigning to that character a place <i>beneath</i> their own conceptions
of what is most excellent; and amid the infinite
varieties of speculation, many forms of this opinion would
undoubtedly arise. Let any one, then, who dissents from the
account which we have given, ask himself this question: Why
is it, that to discover a blemish in a divinity is the same
thing as to renounce faith in him; and that, even in pagan
times, to <i>assail the character</i> of the gods was the constant
mark of an <i>unbelieving</i> age? Is it not clear that, by a
constraining necessity of our being, we are compelled to
regard the godlike and the perfect as identical, and to look
to heaven through the eye of our moral nature? The Intellect
alone, like the telescope waiting for an observer, is quite blind
to the celestial things above it,&mdash;a dead mechanism dipped
in night,&mdash;ready to serve as the dioptric glass, spreading the
images of light from the Infinite on the tender and living
retina of Conscience.</p>

<p>If, then, there is no discernment of Deity except through
our moral sense, the importance of confiding in the perceptions
of that sense,&mdash;of rendering our consciousness of them
vivid and distinct,&mdash;and the corresponding mischief of distrusting
and repudiating these our appointed instructors,&mdash;become
evident. Faith in the human conscience is necessary
to faith in the Divine perfection: and <i>this</i> again is the
needful prelude to the belief in any special revelation. For,
unless we are first assured of the truth and excellence of
God, we cannot tell that his communications may not deceive
us, giving us false notices of things, and agitating us
with illusory hopes and fears. This might be apprehended
from a Being of undetermined benevolence and integrity:
and that this idea of a <i>mendacious revelation</i> has never seriously
entered the minds of men, is a strong proof of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
natural and necessary faith in the rectitude and goodness of
the Divine Administrator of creation. This Moral Perfection
of God being assumed as a postulate in the very idea of
a Revelation, no system of religion which contradicts it can
be admitted as credible <i>on any terms</i>.</p>

<p>Now the whole scheme of Redemption, as it is represented
in the popular theology, appears to us to fall under this
condemnation. Under the <i>names</i> of Justice, Sanctity, Mercy,
it ascribes to the All-perfect a course of sentiment and of
practice which&mdash;it is undeniable&mdash;no other moral agent,
placed in analogous relations, could adopt without the deepest
guilt. The Holiness of God, so often adduced to justify the
severities of this scheme, we would yield to no one in earnestly
maintaining; believing, as we do, that his abhorrence
of moral evil is absolute and everlasting, his resistance to it
real and true, and his love of excellence simply infinite as
his nature. But purity of mind does not express itself by
implacable vengeance against the impure, or oblige its possessor
to engage himself in physically smiting them,&mdash;much
less limit him through all eternity to this mode of administration.
Rather does it incline away from a treatment which
too often adds only torment, and removes no guilt,&mdash;which
makes no advance towards the blessed dispositions it loves,&mdash;which
fevers and parches instead of cooling and melting the
passions of a culprit nature. It is a coarse and wretched
error to suppose that anguish is a specific for sin, to the
incessant infliction of which the Sinless is bound. God never
departs indeed from his devotion to the laws of goodness, and
his design of calling wider and wider virtue into existence:
but he pursues them with the fertility of his infinite free-will;&mdash;now
by the severities of his displeasure,&mdash;now by the
openness of his forgiveness,&mdash;now by the solicitations of his
love. His purpose, as one whose perfection is not merely
spotless, but active and productive, cannot be, as some Christians
seem to say, the penal publication of his personal offence
against the insulters of his law, but the spread and cultivation
throughout his spiritual universe of pure and high affections:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and whenever the new germs of these appear in the garden
of the Lord, no vernal sunshine or summer dews can more
gently cherish the bursting flower, than does his mercy foster
the fair and early growth. The assertion that God cannot
pardon and recall to goodness till he has expended his tortures
upon the evil, seems to us a plain denial of his moral
excellence. Theologians speak as if there were some crime,
or at least some weakness, in the clemency which freely
receives a repentant creature into favor; as if the mercy
which exacts no penalty, when penalty is no longer needed,
were an amiable imbecility of human nature, which only a
loose-principled and unholy being can exercise! as if absolute
unforgiveness were the perfection of sanctity! True, this
is disclaimed in words; and the Eternal Father is called
merciful, for remitting the sinner's doom and transferring the
burden of his guilt to a victim divine and pure. But surely
this disclaimer is more insulting to our moral sense than the
accusation. For, either this transference of righteousness
and guilt is a mere figure of speech, denoting only that, from
the death on Calvary, God took chronological occasion to
pass his own spontaneous pardon, and set up the cross to
<i>mark the date</i> of his volition; or else, if the vicariousness be
not this mere pretence, it describes an outrage upon the first
principles of rectitude, a reckless disregard of all moral considerations,
from the thought of which we are astonished
that all good men do not recoil.</p>

<p>We press once more the question which has never been
answered: How is the alleged immorality of letting off the
sinner mended by the added crime of penally crushing the
Sinless? Of what man&mdash;of what angel&mdash;could such a thing
be reported, without raising a cry of indignant shame from
the universal human heart? What should we think of a
judge who should discharge the felons from the prisons of
a city, because some noble and generous citizen offered himself
to the executioner instead? And if this would be barbarity
below, it cannot be holiness above. Moral excellence
and beauty, we repeat, are no local growths, changing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
species with every clime; nor are the poisonous weeds of this
outer region the chosen adornments of paradise. The principles
of Justice and Right embrace all beings and all times,
and, like the indestructible conception of space, attach themselves
to our contemplation of objects within the remotest
infinitude. It is no more possible that what would be evil in
man should be good in God, than that a circle on earth
should be a square in heaven. Having faith, then, in the
absolute perfection of our Creator, we dare ascribe to Him
nothing which revolts the secret conscience He has given us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>III. The relation which thus subsists between the human
conscience and the Divine excellence leads us to avow, in
the next place, a <span class="smcap">faith</span> in the <i>strictly Divine and Inspired
Character of our own highest Desires and best Affections</i>.
We do not mean by this, that these affections are of miraculous
origin; that their appearance breaks through any regular
law; or that they do not belong to our own nature so as to
form an integrant part of its history; or that they do not
arise spontaneously within it, but require to be precipitated
upon it from without. They are as much properties of our
own minds, as our selfishness and sin: we are <i>conscious</i> of
them, and so they cannot but be parts of our personality.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
But in admitting them to be <i>human</i>, I do not deny that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
are <i>divine</i>: in regarding them as indigenous to our created
spirit, I do not treat them as foreign to the Creator's; nor is
there any inconsistency in believing them to be simultaneously
domesticated with both. That which is <i>included within</i> the
mind of man, is not <i>therefore excluded from</i> the mind of <i>God</i>;
much less is it true that occurrences agreeable to the order of
nature are, by that circumstance, disqualified from being held
the immediate products of the Heavenly Will. The Supreme
Cause, so far from being shut out by his own secondary causes
and natural laws, has now at least no residence, no activity,
no existence, except within them; He covers, penetrates, fills
them; thinks, speaks, executes, through them, as the media of
his volition: and <i>His</i> energy and <i>theirs</i> not only <i>may coincide</i>,
but even <i>must coalesce</i>. He is not to be brought down from
his universal dominion to the rank of <i>one of</i> the physical
causes active in creation, doing that only which the others
have left undone. Will any one stand with me by the midnight
sea, and, because the tides in the deep below hang upon
the moon in the heavens above, forbid me to hear in their
sweep the very voice of God, and tell me that, while they
roll untired on, He sleeps through the silent vault around me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
It is by the law of gravitation that the planets find an unerring
track in the desert space; and is it false, then, that
He "leadeth them forth with his finger," and bids us note, in
pledge of his punctuality, that "not one faileth"? Is there
any error in ascribing the very same event at one time to
gravitation, at another to God? Certainly not; for this is
but one of the forms of his personal activity. And it is the
same in the world of Mind; its natural laws do not exclude,
but, on the contrary, include, the direct Divine agency: and
though <i>my</i> thought, or hope, or love, cannot be <i>yours</i>, they
may yet be God's; not emanations from the God without
us, but inspirations of the God within. Why should we
start to think that there is a part of us which is divine?&mdash;why
image to ourselves a distant, external, contemplative
God, seeing all things and touching nothing, gazing on the
unconscious evolutions of things, as the retired Mechanist of
nature?&mdash;why enthrone Him in the inertness of dead space,
without even a sacred function there, and exclude Him from
the tried, and tempted, and ever-trembling soul of Man? If
we found Him not at home in the secret places of strife and
sorrow, vainly should we wander to seek Him in the colder
regions of nature abroad. We have no sympathy with any
system which denies the doctrine of a Holy Spirit; which
discerns nothing divine in the higher experiences of human
nature; which owns no black abyss and no heavenly heights
in the soul of man, but only a flat, common, midway region,
neither very foul nor very fair,&mdash;well enough for the streets
of traffic, but without a mount of vision and of prayer. Nothing
noble, nothing great, has ever come from a faith which
did not deeply reverence the soul, and stand in awe of it as
the seat of God's own dwelling, the presence-chamber of his
sanctity,&mdash;the focus of that infinite whispering-gallery which
the universe spreads around us.</p>

<p>Nor can we doubt at what point of our own nature we
must stand, in order to hear the voice and feel the inspiration
of the Eternal. The pure in heart&mdash;each in proportion
to his purity&mdash;see Him. Our Conscience, our Moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Perceptions, as we have seen, are our only revealers of God.
In proportion to their clearness do we discern Him; and
behind the clouds that obscure them, He becomes dim, and
vanishes away. The aspirations of duty, the love of excellence,
the disinterested and holy affections, of which every
good heart is conscious, constitute our affinity with Him,&mdash;by
which we know Him, as like knows like: they are the
expression of his mind, the pencil of rays by which He paints
his image on our spiritual nature. God is related to our
soul, like the sun in a stormy sky to the windowed cells in
which mortals live; and as we sit at our work in the chamber
of conscience or of love, the burst of brilliancy or the
sudden gloom within reports to us the clear-shining or the
cloud of the heaven without. Nor can any philosophy,
falsely so called, permanently expel this conviction from the
Christian heart. Every devout and earnest mind naturally
feels that its selfishness and sin are of the earth, earthy,&mdash;the
most offensive of all attitudes to God,&mdash;the infatuated
turning of the back to Him: and, on the other hand, welcomes
the fresh glow of pure Resolve, the heart-felt sob of
Penitence, the glorious Courage that slays Temptation at his
feet,&mdash;each as the gracious gift of a divine strength, and the
authentic voice of the Inspirer, God. By this natural faith
(natural, however, only to the Christian mind) we are prepared
to abide; and, with the Apostle Paul, to own ourselves,
not without deep awe, the very temple of the Holiest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>IV. We have said, that in the Conscience and Moral Affections
we have our <i>only</i> revealers of God. Let it be understood
that we mean our only <i>internal</i> revealers of Him;
the only faculty of our nature capable of furnishing us with
the idea and belief of Him, with any perception of his character,
and allegiance to his will. We mean to state that,
without this faculty, the bare intellect, the mere scientific
and reasoning power, could make no way towards the knowledge
of divine realities; could never, by any system of helps
whatsoever, be trained or guided into this knowledge, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
more than, in the absence of the proper sense, the <i>ear</i> of
the blind can be taught <i>to see</i>; and that nature, life, history,
miracle, notwithstanding their most sedulous discipline, would
leave us utterly in the dark about religion, except so far as
they addressed themselves to our consciousness of what is
holy, just, beautiful, and great. But we do <i>not</i> mean to state
that the Moral Sense can stand alone, dispense with all outward
instruction, and supply a man with a natural religion
ready made. Nor do we mean that the every-day experience
of man, and the ordinary providence of God, are enough,
without special revelation, to lead us to heavenly truth. And
we are therefore prepared to advance another step, and to say,
that, while regarding the human conscience as the only inward
revealer of God, we have <span class="smcap">faith</span> in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> as <i>his perfect and
transcendent outward revelation</i>. We conceive that Jesus of
Nazareth lived and died, not to <i>persuade</i> the Father, not to
<i>appease</i> the Father, not to make a sanguinary <i>purchase</i> from
the Father, but simply to "<i>show</i> us the Father"; to leave
upon the human heart a new, deep, vivid impression of what
God is in himself, and of what he designs for his creature,
man; to become, in short, the accepted interpreter of heaven
and life. And this he achieved, in the only way of which we
can conceive as practicable, by a new disclosure in his own
person of all that is holy and godlike in character,&mdash;startling
the human soul with the sudden apparition of a being diviner
far than it had yet beheld, and lifting its faith at once into
quite another and purer region. If it be true, as we have
ventured to affirm, that to every man his God is his <i>best</i>, you
can by no means give to his faith a <i>higher God</i>, till you have
given to his heart a <i>better best</i>,&mdash;till you have touched him
with a profounder sense of sanctity and excellence, and purified
and enlarged the perceptions of his conscience. Nor can
you do <i>this</i>, except by presenting him with nobler models,
with the living form of a fairer and sublimer goodness, visibly
transcending every object of his previous reverence. No
verbal teaching, no didactic rules, can transform any man's
moral taste, and place before his mental view a lovelier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
truer image of perfection: as well might you hope, by definition,
and precept, and book-wisdom, to train an artist with a
soul like Raffaelle, or an eye like Claude. But only give the
glorious model to the mind, <i>produce</i> the most finished excellence
and harmony, and our instinctive sympathy with goodness
feels and discerns it instantly, and, though unable to
conceive it inventively beforehand, recognizes it reverently
afterwards. And so Christ, standing in solitary greatness,
and invested with unapproachable sanctity, opens at once the
eye of conscience to perceive and know the pure and holy
God, the Father that dwelt in him and made him so full of
truth and grace. Him that rules in heaven we can in no
wise believe to be <i>less perfect</i> than that which is most divine
on earth; of anything <i>more perfect</i> than the meek yet majestic
Jesus, no heart can ever dream. And, accordingly, ever since
he visited our earth with blessing, the soul of Christendom has
worshipped a God resembling him,&mdash;a God of whom he was
the image and impersonation;&mdash;and, <i>therefore, not</i> the God
of which philosophy dreams,&mdash;a mere Infinite physical Force,
without spirituality, without love, chiefly engaged in whirling
the fly-wheel of nature, and sustaining the material order
of the heavens, and weaving in the secret workshop of
creation new textures of life and beauty; <i>not</i> the God of
which natural theology speaks, the mere chief of ingenious
mechanicians, more optical, and dynamical, and architectural,
than our most skilful engineers,&mdash;a cold intellectual
Being, in the severe immensity and immutability of whose
mind all warm emotions are absorbed and dissolved; <i>not</i> the
God of Calvinism, creating a race with certain foresight of
the eternal damnation of the many, and against the few refusing
to relax his frown except at the spectacle of blood;&mdash;but
the Infinite Spirit, so holy, so affectionate, so pitiful, whom
Jesus felt to be in him as his Inspirer; who passes by no
wounds of sin or sorrow; who stills the winds and waves of
terror, to the perishing that call on him in faith; who stops
the procession of our grief, and bids bereaved affection weep
no more, but wait upon the voice that even the dead obey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
who scathes the hypocrite with the lightning of conviction,
and permits the penitent to wash his feet with tears; who
reckons most his own the gentlest follower, that rests the
head and turns up the trustful eye on him; and bends that
look of piercing love upon the guilty which best rebukes the
guilt. Jesus has given us a faith never held before, and still
too much obscured, in the <i>affectionateness</i> of the Great Ruler;
has made Him our own domestic God, whose ample home
encircles all, leaving not the solitary, the sinner, or the sad
without a place in the mansions of his house; has wrapped
us in the Divine immensity without fear, and bid us claim
the warm sun in heaven as our Paternal hearth, and the
vault of the pure sky as our protecting roof.</p>

<p>We have spoken of Christ's personal representation, in
his own character and practical life, of the spirit of the Divine
Mind, and have explained how in this way we believe
that he has "shown us the Father." This, however, is not
all. His <i>direct teachings</i>, perfectly in harmony with his life,
confirm and extend its lessons; and we listen, with venerating
faith, to his inimitable exposition of all divine truth.
Purity of soul makes the most wonderful discoveries in heavenly
things, and is indeed the pellucid atmosphere through
which the remoter lights of God are "spiritually discerned."
As we have said, the knowledge of him which any mind (be
it of man or of angel) may possess, is just proportioned to
its sanctity: and our Messiah, having the very highest sanctity,
was enabled to speak with the highest and most authoritative
knowledge, and was inspired to be our infallible
guide, not perhaps in trivial questions of literary interpretation,
or scientific fact, or historical expectation, but in all
the deep and solemn relations on which our sanctification
and immortal blessedness depend. And both to his person
and to his teachings do the miracles of his life, the tragedy
of his crucifixion, and the glory of his resurrection, articulately
call the attention of all ages, as with the voice of
God. In every way we discern in Christ the transcendent
revelation of the Most High. We are told, that this is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<i>dishonor Christ</i>. We think it, however, a more glorious
honor to him, to be thus indissolubly folded within the intimacy
of the Father's love, than to be blasted by the tempest
of his wrath; nor could we ever trust and venerate a God
who&mdash;like the barbarians in the judgment-hall&mdash;could
smite that meek lamb of heaven with one rude blow of
vengeance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>V. But we hasten to observe, finally, that <span class="smcap">we have faith</span>
in <span class="smcap">Human Immortality</span>, as exemplified in the heavenly life
to which Jesus ascended. To assure us of this great truth,
it were enough that Jesus assumed and taught it; that it
was his great postulate, essential to the development of his
own character, and to all his views of the purposes of life,&mdash;an
integrant part of his insight into human responsibility
and his version of human duty. For if <i>he</i> did not teach the
reality of God in this matter, sure we are that none else has
ever done so; and most of all, that the sceptics who doubt
the heavenly futurity have no claim to take his place as
our instructors. For if this hope were a delusion, <i>who</i> would
the mistaken be? Will any one tell me, that the voluptuary,
who, from abandonment to the body, cannot imagine the
perpetuity of the spirit;&mdash;that the selfish, who, looking at
the meanness of his own nature, sees nothing worth immortalizing;&mdash;that
the contented Epicurean, who, in prudent
quietude of sense and sympathy, finds adequate satisfaction
in this mortal life;&mdash;that the cold speculator, who looks at
the fouler side of human nature, and, showing us on its
features the pallor of sensualism or the hard lines of guilt,
deems it less fit for the duration of the angel than for the
extinction of the brute;&mdash;that these men are <i>right</i>; while
Christ, who walked without despair through the deepest
haunts of sin, with faith that succumbed not to wretchedness
and wrong, but stood up and conquered them; who embraced
our whole nature in his love, and displayed it in its
perfectness; who lived and died in its utmost service, with
prayers and tears and blood; to whom our most binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
affections cling almost with worship as the holiest glory of
our world;&mdash;that <i>he</i> could be under a delusion <i>here</i>?&mdash;that
when, sinking in trustful death, he laid his meek head to
rest on the bosom of the Father, he was cast off, and dropped
on the cold clod?&mdash;that he sobbed into the Infinite by night
with a vain love that met no answer?&mdash;that God rather
takes part in his providence with the mean-souled, the
cynic, the morbid, the selfish? There <i>is</i> no greater impossibility
than this, on which evidence can fall back. Nay,
we confess that, even apart from his doctrine, the mere
mortal history of Christ would have settled with us the question
of futurity. For the great essential to this belief is a
sufficiently elevated estimate of human nature: no man will
ever deny its immortality who has a deep impression of its
capacity for so great a destiny. And this impression is so
vividly given by the life of Jesus,&mdash;he presents an image
of the soul so grand, so divine,&mdash;as utterly to dwarf all the
dimensions of its present career, and to necessitate a heaven
for its reception. At all events, it is allowable to feel this,
when we see that this natural sequel was actually and perceptibly
appended; that this "Holy One of God could not
see corruption," but rose, above the reach of mortal ill, to
the world where now he welcomes the souls of the sainted
dead. That other life we take to be a scene for the
mind's ampler and ampler development, apart from those
animal and selfish elements which now deform and degrade
it by their excess. And this alone, if there were nothing
else, would render it a life of awful retribution. For to the
wicked, what is this loss of "the natural man," but total
bereavement and utter death of joy?&mdash;what to the good, but
a glad and sacred birth?&mdash;to the one, a Promethean exile
on a mid-rock in the ocean of night, under the bite of a
remorse that gnaws impalpably, felt always, but never seen,&mdash;to
the other, a welcome to the loving homes of the blest,
amid the sunshine of the everlasting hills? Yet precisely
because we believe in Retribution, do we trust in Restoration.
The very abhorrence with which a man's better mind ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
looks upon his worse, while it inflicts his punishment, begins
his cure: and we can never allow that God will suspend this
natural law impressed by himself on our spiritual constitution,
merely in order to stop the process of moral recovery,
and specially enable him to maintain the eternity of torment
and of sin. And so, beyond the dark close of life rise before
us the awful contrasts of retribution; and in the farther distance,
the dim but glorious vision of a purified, redeemed, and
progressive universe of souls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, are our Five Points of Christianity, considered
as a system of positive religious doctrine, viz.:&mdash;1st. The
truth of the Moral Perceptions in man,&mdash;not, as the degenerate
churches of our day teach, their pravity and blindness;
2dly. The Moral Perfection of the character of God,&mdash;in
opposition to the doctrine of his Arbitrary Decrees and
Absolute Self-will; 3dly. The Natural awakening of the
Divine Spirit within us,&mdash;rather than its Preternatural
communication from without; 4thly. Christ, the pure Image
and highest Revelation of the Eternal Father,&mdash;not his Victim
and his Contrast; 5thly. A universal Immortality after
the model of Christ's heavenly life; an immortality not of
capricious and select salvation, with unimaginable torment as
the general lot, but, for all, a life of spiritual development,
of retribution, of restoration.</p>

<p>To the <i>Moral</i> doctrine which, in our view, the Gospel
conjoins with this religious system, it is impossible for us
at present to advert. Suffice to say that, with Paul, we exclaim,
"not <i>Law</i>, but <i>Love</i>":&mdash;love to God, to Christ, not
simply for what they have done for us, but chiefly for what
they are in themselves;&mdash;nothing like the narrow-hearted
gratitude for an exclusive salvation, but a <i>moral</i> affection
awakened by their holiness, rectitude, truth, and mercy,&mdash;by
the sublimity and spirituality of their designs, and the
sanctity and fidelity of their execution: love also to man,
looking to him not merely as a sentient being who is to
be made <i>happy</i>, but as a child of God, who is to be raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
into some likeness to the Divine image; as a brother spirit,
noble in nature, even though sinful in fact, glorious as an
immortal in the eye of God, though disfigured by this world's
hardship or contempt.</p>

<p>Does any one ask, <i>where we get</i> our system of faith and
morals? What are the principles of reasoning which we
apply to nature and Scripture to extract it thence? The
reply would require a volume of exposition. Suffice it to
say, that we think we have full warrant for this belief from
the Scriptures of the New Testament, with which alone we
conceive that Christians have any practical concern; that,
in interpreting these Scriptures, we follow the same rules
which we should apply to any other books; that not even
could their instructions make us false to that sense of right
and wrong which God has breathed into us; that if they
taught respecting him anything unjust or unholy, we should
not accept <i>it</i>, but reject <i>them</i>; and that, as to the points of
faith on which we have dwelt, some receive these truths
because they were taught by Christ; others receive Christ
because he taught these truths.</p>

<p>On this faith we desire to take our stand, with the firmness,
but without the ferocity, of the first Reformers. Opposing
churches tell us, we "are so frigid"! Why, it is the very
thing our own hearts had often said to us; for there is nothing
that so promptly rebukes the coldness of our nature as
the warmth of our faith. We do not, however, much admire
this mutual criticism of each other's temperature; and
strongly suspect the reality of that earnestness which prides
itself on its own intensity. We must not propose to assume
any artificial heats, in order to spite and disprove this frequent
accusation; but be resolved, in an age diseased with
pretence, to remain realities, to profess nothing which we do
not believe, to withhold nothing whereon we doubt, to affect
nothing which we do not feel, to promise nothing which we
will not do; holding, with Paul, that simplicity and sincerity
are truly the godliest of things. With Heaven's good help,
may we bear our testimony thus; deeming it a small thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to be judged by man's judgment; and, with such light and
heat as God shall put into our hearts, delivering over our
portion of truth to generations that will give it a more genial
welcome. There is greatness in a faith, when it can win a
wide success or make rapid conquest over submissive minds.
There is a higher greatness in a faith that, when God ordains,
can stand up and do without success;&mdash;unmoved amid the
pitiless storms of a fanatic age; with foot upon the rock of its
own fidelity, and heart in the serene Infinite above the canopy
of cloud and tempest.</p>

<p>When a stranger knocks at the gate of the Clarendon
Printing-house, and presents his petition for aid, the University
of Oxford maintains its national character for good-natured
opulence,&mdash;gives its money and signs its name, without
very close inquiry into the case. The documents are really
so respectable that there cannot be much amiss; and a venerable
institution, well known to be fond of the house, cannot be
expected to go trudging through the back-lanes of history, and
exposing its nostrils in the purlieus of heresy, in order to
identify a literary petitioner, evidently above all common imposture.
So it supplies all his wants upon the spot, dresses
him handsomely, and sends him out into the world as its worthy
(though eccentric) friend, the catechist of Alexandria.
The introduction, being left at the Prussian Legation, falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
into the hands of no stay-at-home benefactor, but of one who
knows the by-ways of human life, and has an ear for the dialects
of many a place. M. Bunsen&mdash;as Oxford might have
remembered&mdash;is not unacquainted with Egypt; and no sooner
does he raise his eyes from the credentials to the person of
the stranger, than he discovers him to be no disciple of the
Alexandrine Clement; recognizes the accent of the West; is
reminded of the voice of Irenæus; and, finally, being even
more familiar with the Tiber than the Nile, detects a Roman
beneath the mask of Origen. We do not in the least grudge
the friend of Niebuhr the honor of a discovery which no one
could turn to more effectual account; but every English scholar
must feel mortified that the <i>Imprimatur</i> of our great Ecclesiastical
University should appear on a title-page manifestly
false; that the first reader should see at a glance what the
learned proprietors had missed; and that their <i>Editio Princeps</i>
of a recovered monument of Church antiquity should be
superseded within a year or two of its publication. They are
not principals, it is true, but only secondaries to the Editor, in
the commission of this error: still, a lay bibliographer might
reasonably expect, in resorting for aid to so renowned and
reverend a body, that his own judgment would be kept in
check; and their very consent to issue the work implies <i>some</i>
critical opinion of its value, as derived from age and authorship.
Whether they are called upon to adopt at once M.
Bunsen's proposed title-page, and substitute the name of Hippolytus
for that of Origen, we will not say; but that the present
title gives the book to the wrong author, seems placed
beyond the reach of doubt.</p>

<p>M. Emmanuel Miller, one of the curators of the National
Library in Paris, was the first to make himself acquainted
with the contents of this work, and to appreciate their importance.
Among the manuscripts under his care was one on
cotton paper of the fourteenth century, which had been
brought from Mount Athos in 1842, by M. Mynoïdes Mynas,
a Greek agent employed by the French government to
search the neglected treasures of that celebrated spot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
superscription, "On all Heresies," was not inviting; but on
turning over the leaves, some lines, unknown before, of Pindar
and of another lyric poet, were found and copied; and the
value of these excerpts being ascertained, M. Miller's attention
was directed to the body of the treatise containing them.
The treatise had already been described, in the <i>Moniteur</i> of
the 5th of January, 1844, as a Refutation of all Heresies, in
ten books, but with the first three missing, as well as the conclusion
of the whole; and he soon became aware, that, of the
three missing books, the first already existed, and had been
printed under the name of "Philosophumena," in the editions
of Origen's works. Its very title is found in the manuscript
at the end of the fourth book, and denotes that the portion
of the work there concluded completes the sketch of philosophical
systems, which the author prefixes to his account of
ecclesiastical aberrations; and there are mutual references,
backwards and forwards, between the printed book and the
manuscript, which leave no doubt that the latter is a sequel
to the former. The Editor, therefore, has very properly reprinted
the "Philosophumena" as the commencement of the
newly recovered work; which thus exhibits a regular plan,
and consists of two parts, viz.: first, four books,&mdash;of which
the second and third are lost,&mdash;expounding the Pagan philosophies,
especially the Greek, from which, the author contends,
the various heresies of Christendom are mere plagiarisms;
then six books, containing an account, in an order prevailingly
historical, of thirty or thirty-two heresies, supported
by extracts from their standard writings, and wound up in the
recapitulary book at the end by the writer's own profession of
faith. Now who is the author?</p>

<p>Not Origen; for, as Huet had already remarked respecting
the "Philosophumena," the writer speaks of himself in terms
implying an episcopal position; and, in the ninth book, he
gives an account of transactions in Rome, extending over
many years, in which he was evidently an eyewitness and an
actor. While the scene is thus laid at a distance from Origen's
sphere, and the date also of the personal matter runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
back into his boyhood, the cast of the theological doctrine is
wholly different from his; for instance, in a certain "Treatise
on the Universe," to which the author refers as his own, and
of which a fragment is preserved, the penal condition of the
wicked after death is said to be immutable;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but Origen, it is
well known, taught a doctrine of final restoration. Add to
this, that no such work as the present is attributed to Origen
by any ancient witness, and the case against his name may be
regarded as complete.</p>

<p>The evidence which disappoints this claim narrows also our
choice of others. The personal transactions to which we
have referred took place at Rome, while Zephyrinus and his
successor, Callistus, presided over the Christian community
there, that is, during the first twenty years of the third century.
We must, therefore, look for our author among the
metropolitan clergymen of that period. Still closer is the circle
drawn by the fact, that the writer largely borrows from
the treatise of Irenæus on the same subject; and, though vastly
improving on that foolish production, and copiously contributing
fresh materials, betrays the general affinity of thought
which unites the stronger disciple with the feebler master.</p>

<p>The problem then being to find a pupil of the Bishop of
Lyons among the ecclesiastics of Rome, at the beginning of
the third century, two names are given in as answering the
conditions,&mdash;those of Hippolytus, a suburban clergyman, and
of Caius, whose charge lay within the city itself. In order to
vindicate the claim of the first, it has been necessary for M.
Bunsen to prove that his locality is right; and that the "Portus
Romæ," of which he was bishop, was not, as Le Moyne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and Cave had groundlessly supposed, the Arabian "Portus
Romanus" of the district of Aden, but the new harbor made,
or at least enlarged, by Trajan, on the northern bank of the
Tiber, immediately opposite to Ostia. That he suffered martyrdom
there, and was buried in a cemetery on the Tiburtine
road, is generally admitted, on the evidence of Prudentius,
who has left a poem describing his memorial chapel on that
spot, and of a statue of him, seated in a cathedra, which was
dug up there three hundred years ago, and now stands in the
library of the Vatican. It is certainly perplexing to find Jerome
avowing ignorance of the see over which he presided, if,
for a quarter of a century, he was active at the centre of the
Christian world; and not less so to discover in Rome itself,
nay, in a Pope, or his transcriber, at the end of the fifth century,
the impression that his scene of labor had been in Arabia;
and under the influence of these facts it has been supposed
that though, coming to Italy, he had fallen among the
martyrs of the West, he ought to be reckoned among the
bishops of the East. On the whole, however, the reasons
preponderate in favor of his residence, as "Episcopus Portuensis,"
within the presbytery of Rome. The title itself is an
old one, still always assigned to some dignitary of the curia,
and, no doubt, deriving its origin from the time when the
Northern Harbor of the Tiber&mdash;of which in the ninth century,
scarce a trace was left&mdash;was a flourishing emporium.
The name of Hippolytus is associated by tradition with the
spot; it is given, our author assures us, to a certain tower,
near Fiumicino; and in the eighth and ninth centuries, a basilica
of St. Hippolytus was restored at Portus by Leo III. and
IV. An episcopal palace still remains. By acute and skilful
combinations, effected with evidence scanty as a whole, and
suspicious in every part, M. Bunsen has endeavored to reproduce
the historical image of Hippolytus. His office of
"bishop" implied simply the charge of the single congregation
at Portus; the members of that congregation were the
"plebs" committed to his supervision; the city or village in
which they lived was his diocese. His vicinity to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
capital drew him, however, into a wider circle of duties. For
while Rome itself was divided into several ecclesiastical districts,
each of which had its own clergyman and lay deacons,
the suburban bishops were associated with these officers to
form a committee of management, or presbytery, presided
over by the metropolitan. By his seat at this board, he was
kept in living contact with all the most stirring interests of
Christendom, which, wherever their origin might be, found
their way to the imperial city, and more and more sought
their equilibrium there. At a commercial seaport, his own
congregation would largely consist of temporary settlers and
mercantile agents, Greek brokers, Jewish bankers, African
importers, to whom Italy was a lodging-house rather than a
home; and by the continual influx of foreigners he would
hear tidings of the remotest churches, and carry to the clerical
meetings in the city the newest gossip of all the heresies.
Possibly this position, with its opportunities of various intercourse,
may have contributed to form in him the agreeable address,
and faculty of eloquent speech, which tradition ascribes
to him; and induced him to commence the practice of writing
with studious care the homilies which were to be delivered in
the congregation. At all events he is the first of whom we
distinctly hear as a great preacher. His period extends, it is
supposed, from the reign of Commodus (180-193) to the first
year of Maximin (235-6); and so brought him into the
same presbytery-room with five popes,&mdash;Victor (187-198);
Zephyrinus (201-218); Callistus (219-222); Urbanus
(223-230); and Pontianus (230-235); with the last of
whom he shared, in the last year of his life, a cruel exile to
Sardinia, and returned only to fall a victim to fresh informations,
and suffer martyrdom by drowning in a canal. It cannot
be denied that, in order to recover this picture of Hippolytus,
and still more in order to fix his literary position, the
materials of evidence have to be dealt with in somewhat
arbitrary fashion, and their <i>lacunæ</i> to be filled by conjecture.
Prudentius, for instance, is called as an historical witness, yet
convicted of fable in much of what he says. His poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
declares that at one time Hippolytus had supported Novatus
in his attempt to close the gates of repentance against the
<i>Lapsi</i>, but had been reconciled to the catholic doctrine before
he died. He must in this case have joined in the opposition
raised by Novatianus (in 251) to the election of Cornelius to
the papacy, and have died in the Decian persecution, which
continued till the year 257. Moreover, the painting seen by
the Spanish versifier on the walls of the memorial chapel
introduces us to so ridiculous a story, as only to show how
completely the martyrological legends had already escaped all
the restraints of history. In this fresco the mythical fate of
Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, is transferred to the Roman
presbyter: he is represented as torn to pieces by horses;
while the faithful follow to pick up his limbs and hair, and
sponge away the blood upon the ground. If the sanctuary
exhibiting this scene received the martyr's remains from their
original resting-place as early as the time of Constantine,&mdash;and
such is our author's opinion,&mdash;into what a state of degradation
had the history of Hippolytus sunk in three quarters
of a century! And if already memorial painting could thus
impudently lie, how can we better trust the statue, admitted
to be later still? Yet this statue, on whose side is a list of
the writings of Hippolytus, is appealed to in determining the
martyr's written productions, as the painted chapel in evidence
of facts in his personal career. We fully admit the success
of M. Bunsen in eliciting a possible result from a mass of
intricate and tangled conditions, and presenting us with a
highly interesting personage. But perhaps, as the venerable
image of the good bishop has grown in clearness before his
eye, and attracted his affection more and more, the very
vividness of the conception may have rendered him insensible
to the precariousness of the proof. Ecclesiastical fancy, in its
unrestrained career, has torn his personality to pieces, and
left the <i>disjecta membra</i> so rudely scattered on the strand of
history, that we almost doubt the power of any critical Æsculapius
to restore him to the world again.</p>

<p>At the same board of church councillors with Hippolytus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
sat another λογιωτατος ανηρ,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the presbyter Caius; and as an
urban clergyman, he would be more constantly there than his
suburban brother, separated by a distance of eighteen miles.
To form any living image of him from the scanty notices of
him which begin with Eusebius and end with Photius, is quite
impossible. In one respect only do the personal characteristics
attributed to him distinguish him from the bishop of
Portus. He was a strenuous opponent of the peculiarities
favored by the Christians of Lesser Asia, and especially of
the claims to prophetic gifts, and the appeal to clairvoyant
skill, by Montanus and his followers. With one of these, by
name Proclus, he held a disputation; from which Eusebius
has preserved a passage or two, showing, in conjunction with
the title, not very intelligibly assigned to him, of "Bishop of
the Gentiles," that he belonged to the most advanced anti-Jewish
party in the Church, lamented the grossness of the
popular millenarian dreams, vindicated the apostolic dignity
of the Roman against the pretensions of the Eastern Christianity,
and disowned the Epistle to the Hebrews. This
feature in the figure of Caius, though constituting the distinction,
does not, however, necessarily <i>oppose</i> him to Hippolytus,
whose attitude towards the Montanists may not have been
very different, but only less positively marked. Still the
suspicions directed against the two men are of an opposite
kind: with Hippolytus, the difficulty is to set him clear of
sympathy with Montanism;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> with Caius, to prevent his being
classed with its unmeasured opponents, the Alogi.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And a
report even reaches us, that among the Chaldean Christians
there exists, or did exist in the fourteenth century, a controversial
treatise of Hippolytus against Caius.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p><p>Between these two men, so similar in position, and not,
perhaps, unused to sharp argument face to face, springs up, at
the end of all these ages, a rival claim to property in the
"Refutation of all the Heresies." The chief counsel for
Hippolytus, besides our author, are the eminent Professors
Jacobi, Duncker, and Schneidewin,&mdash;all, we believe, belonging
to the Neander school of theology; and as the last two
are about to edit the work anew, and probably to give it its
final form, their opinion of its authorship may be expected to
prevail. The other side, however, advocated by Dr. Fessler,
is sustained by perhaps the greatest of living historical critics,
F. C. Baur, representative of the much-abused Tübingen
school. Into so intricate a question we might be excused for
inviting our readers, had we anything fresh to offer towards
its solution; but the chief impression we have brought from
its study is one of astonishment at the extreme positiveness
with which the learned men on either side affirm their own
conclusion. A more equal balance of evidence we never
remember to have met with in any similar research; and the
faint and slender preponderance which alone the scale can
ever exhibit, amusingly contrasts with the triumphant assertion,
of both sets of disputants, that not a reasonable doubt
remains. The leading points of M. Bunsen's case are these.
A work "On all Heresies" is attributed to Hippolytus, and
in no instance to Caius, by Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and
Peter of Alexandria, at the beginning of the fourth century.
Such a book was still extant in the ninth century; for Photius,
the celebrated patriarch of Constantinople, has given us
an account of its contents in the journal and epitome of his
studies which he has left us. On comparing his report with
the newly discovered book, the identity of the two works is
established in some important respects: the <i>number</i> and <i>concluding
term</i> of the series of heresies are the same; they
both of them include materials taken from Irenæus, while
reversing his order of treatment. Further, in the newly
found treatise reference is made by the author to other works
of his, in which he has discussed certain points of early Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
chronology in proving the antiquity of the Abrahamic
race. Now, Eusebius was acquainted with a certain "Chronicle"
of Hippolytus, brought down to the first year of Alexander
Severus; and such a chronicle, in a Latin translation,
is found in Fabricius's edition of Hippolytus, only that its list
of Roman emperors terminates, not with the beginning, but
with the end, of Severus's reign. It has, however, in common
with our work, a peculiar number of tribes,&mdash;viz. seventy-two,
derived from Noah. Thus, the author of the "Heresies"
and of the "Chronicle" would appear to be the same,
and, according to Eusebius, to be Hippolytus. Lastly, both
in our new work, and also in a book called the "Labyrinth,"
written against some Unitarians of the second century, reference
is made to a treatise "On the Universe," which the
author mentions as his own production. By printing a fragment
of this last in his edition of "Hippolytus," Fabricius has
shown to what name all three should, in his judgment, be set
down; and that they cannot be given to Caius is rendered
evident by the occurrence, in the fragment, of certain Apocalyptic
fictions inconsistent with his rejection of the Book of
Revelations. Moreover, the list of works on the statue of
Hippolytus includes a disquisition "Against the Greeks and
against Plato, or <i>Respecting the Universe</i>."</p>

<p>What can be said to weaken so strong a case? Two
doubts at once arise upon it, which we find it by no means
easy to set aside. Granted, Hippolytus wrote a book "On
all Heresies"; is it the same which is now delivered into our
hands? One medium of comparison we possess, enabling us
to place the original and the present book, for a short space,
side by side. The very Peter of Alexandria who is one of
the early witnesses called on Hippolytus's behalf has handed
down to us a passage or two (preserved in the Paschal Chronicle)
from the book which he attests, with a distinct reference
to the place where they are to be found. We turn to the
right chapter, and the passages are <i>not there</i>. Nor is it a
mere want of verbal agreement which we have to regret; the
same topic&mdash;the controversy about the time of Easter&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
treated; the same side&mdash;that of the Western Church&mdash;is
taken, in both instances; but the arguments are different, and
so far irreconcilable, that no one who had command of that
which Peter gives would ever resort to the feebler one which
our work contains. With the dauntless ingenuity of German
criticism M. Bunsen makes a virtue of necessity, and endeavors
to convert this unfortunate discrepancy into a fresh
proof of identity. He thinks that, in this and some other
parts, our work is but a clumsy abstract of Hippolytus's
original, which the citations of Peter enable us to recover
and complete. This, however, is a plea which, it strikes us,
damages his case as much by success as it could by failure.
For if the book presented to us by the Clarendon Press
reflects the original no better than would appear from this
only sample which it is in our power to test, it may indeed be
a degenerate descendant from the pen of Hippolytus; but all
reliable identity is lost, and the traces of his hand are no
longer recoverable. The second doubt is this:&mdash;Is the work
which Photius read the same that has now been rescued? Of
the few descriptive marks supplied by the patriarch, there are
as many absent from our work as present in it. The treatise
which he read was a "<i>little book</i>" or "<i>tract</i>," as Lardner calls
it (βιβλιδαριον), a word which can scarcely apply to a volume
extending (as ours would, if complete) to four hundred and
twenty octavo pages. M. Bunsen cuts down this number to
two hundred and fifty, by supposing Photius to have only the
last six books, containing the historical survey, without the
groundwork of the philosophical deduction, of the heresies.
The curtailment, if conceded, seems scarcely adequate to its
purpose, and appears to us a very questionable conjecture.
The manuscript, stripped of the first four books, would want
the very basis of the whole argument; and, if such a mutilation
were conceivable, it is impossible that Photius should fail
to observe and mention it; for the fifth book opens, not like
an independent treatise, but with a summary statement of
what has been accomplished "<i>in the four books preceding
this</i>." Again, Photius mentions the <i>Dositheans</i> as the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
set of heretics discussed; whereas their name does not occur
at all, if we remember right, in our work, and their place is
occupied by the "Ophites." M. Bunsen treats this as a mere
inaccuracy of expression on the part of Photius, who meant,
by the name "Dositheans," to indicate the same "earliest
Judaizing schools" that are better described as "Ophites."
The name, however, is so unsuitable to this purpose, that it
would be a strange wilfulness in the learned patriarch to substitute
it for the language of the author he describes. He
could not be ignorant that Dositheus, Simon, Menander, were
the three founders of the Samaritan sect, exponents of the
same doctrine, if not even reputed <i>avatars</i> of the same divine
essence;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and if he had applied the name <i>Dositheans</i> to
any of the heretics enumerated in our work, it would assuredly
have been to the <i>followers of Simon</i>, who stand <i>fourth</i> in
the series of thirty-two, and not to Phrygian serpent-worshippers,
who commence the list. Further, the author whom
Photius read stated that his book was a synopsis of the Lectures
of Irenæus. In our work no such statement occurs;
and the use made of Irenæus does not agree, either in quantity
or character, with the substance of the assertion. And,
lastly, the patriarch's Hippolytus said "some things which
are not quite correct; for instance, that the Epistle to the
Hebrews is not by the Apostle Paul." In our work there is
no such assertion; and when M. Bunsen suggests that perhaps
its place might be in the lost books, he forgets that,
according to his own conjecture, these books were no more in
Photius's hands than in ours, and that he cannot first cut them
off in order to make a βιβλιδαριον, and then restore them, to
provide a locus for a missing criticism on the Epistle to the
Hebrews. The identity of our "Philosophumena" with the
treatise which Photius read and Hippolytus wrote, appears,
therefore, to be extremely problematical.</p>

<p>One fixed point, however, is gained in the course of the
argument, and gives an acknowledged position from which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
opposite opinions are willing to set out. Whoever wrote the
disquisition "On the Universe" wrote also our work. This
fact rests on the assertion of the author himself; yet, if the
author be Hippolytus, and our "Philosophumena" be his
"Refutation of all Heresies," it is strange that no list of his
writings mentions <i>both</i> books: the catalogues of Eusebius and
Jerome naming the "Heresies" without the essay "On the
Universe"; and the engraving on the statue giving the essay
"On the Universe" without the "Heresies." How can we explain
it, that these ecclesiastical writers, in knowing our work,
did not know what is contained in it about the authorship of
the other book; and that this book should have wandered
<i>anonymously</i> about down to the ninth century, side by side
with an acknowledged writing of Hippolytus, which all the
while was proclaiming the solution of the question? We
should certainly expect that the book of avowed authorship
would convey the name of Hippolytus to the companion production
for which it claims the same paternity; but, instead
of this, it not only leaves its associate anonymous for six
hundred years, but afterward assumes the modest fit, and
becomes anonymous itself. Even if no previous reader had
sense enough to put the two things together, and pick out the
testimony of the one book to the origin of the other, are we
to charge the same stupidity on the erudite Photius, who had
both books in his hand, and has given his report of both? In
his account of Hippolytus's treatise, he nowhere tells us that it
contains a reference to the essay "On the Universe," as being
from the same pen; and that he found no such reference is
certain; for he actually discusses the question, "Who wrote
the essay on the Universe?" without ever mentioning Hippolytus
at all. Just such a reference, however, as he did <i>not</i> find
in Hippolytus, he <i>did</i> find in <i>another</i> work, of which he speaks
under the title of "The Labyrinth"; and, strange to say, it
was at the <i>end</i> of the work,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> precisely where it stands in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
"Philosophumena." Who can resist the suspicion, that the
anonymous "Labyrinth" of Photius is no other than our
anonymous "Philosophumena"? This conviction forced
itself upon us on first weighing the evidence collected by
M. Bunsen, in support of his different conclusion; and we
observe that it is the opinion sustained by the great authority
of Baur,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> who even finds a trace in our work of the very
<i>title</i> given by Photius; the writer observing, at the beginning
of the tenth book, "The <i>Labyrinth of Heresies</i> we have not
broken through by violence, but have resolved by refutation
alone with the force of truth; and now we come to the positive
exposition of the truth." At all events, the difference of
title in the case of a work having probably more names than
one, is of no weight in disproof of identity. With this new
designation in our possession, we may return to search for
our book in the records of ecclesiastical antiquity; and we
have not far to go, before we alight on traces affording hopes
of a result. No "Labyrinth," indeed, turns up in the literary
history of earlier centuries than Photius; but a "<i>Little</i> Labyrinth"
is mentioned by Theodoret,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as sometimes ascribed to
Origen, but as evidently not his; and from his account of it,
confirmed by the matter which he borrows from it, we learn
that it was a controversial book, against a set of Unitarians in
Rome, followers of Theodotus. It so happens that the very
passage from this tract which Theodoret has used appears
also, with others from the same source, in Eusebius, only
quoted under another title,&mdash;the book being called a "Work
against the Heresy of Artemon" (who was another teacher
of the same school in the same age). The extracts thus preserved
to us are not found in our work; which, therefore, if it
be the "Labyrinth," is a distinct production from the "Little
Labyrinth"; but they are so manifestly from the same pen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
occupied in the same task, as to render it perfectly conceivable
that the two books might receive the same name, with
only a diminutive epithet to distinguish the lesser from the
greater. Nor are we left, as Baur has shown, without a distinct
assertion by our "great unknown," that he had already
composed a smaller treatise on the same subject; for, in the
introduction to the "Philosophumena," he says of the heretics,
"We have before given a brief exposition of their opinions,
refuting them in the gross, without presenting them in
detail." This shorter work would naturally treat of the particular
forms of error most immediately present and mischievous
before the author's eyes; and if he dwelt especially on
the doctrines of Theodotus and Artemon, it is just what we
should expect from an orthodox Roman. This essay, on a
limited range of heresy, would naturally be issued at first
with the special title by which Eusebius refers to it. But if
it led the author to execute afterwards a much enlarged
design, to which, from its intricate extent, he gave, on its
completion, the fanciful designation of "The Labyrinth," he
might naturally carry the name back to the earlier production,
and, to mark the relation between the two, issue this in future
as "The Little Labyrinth." Photius speaks of the tract
against the heresy of Artemon as a separate work from
"The Labyrinth,"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and says the same thing of the latter<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
that Theodoret had remarked of the former, that by some it
was ascribed to Origen. The result to which we are thus led
is the following. Our newly found work is not Hippolytus's
βιβλιδαριον "On all Heresies," but the book known to Photius
as "The Labyrinth"; the author of which had previously
produced two other works, viz. "The Little Labyrinth" mentioned
by Theodoret, and quoted under another name by
Eusebius, and the "Treatise on the Universe," whose contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Photius reports. Whatever, therefore, fixes the authorship of
any of these, fixes the authorship of all.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, our threefold chance, we have
only a solitary evidence on this point. Attached to Photius's
copy of the "Treatise on the Universe" was a note, to the
effect that the book was not (as had been imagined) by Josephus,
but by Caius, the Roman presbyter, who also composed
the "Labyrinth."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In the absence of other external
testimony, this judgment appears entitled to stand, unless the
books themselves disclose some features at variance with the
known character of Caius.</p>

<p>But, it is said, such variance we do actually find. For
while our work expressly appeals to the Apocalypse as the
production of John, we know from Eusebius that Caius
ascribed it to Cerinthus, and, in opposing himself to Montanism,
rejected the millenarian doctrine which is taught in the
Revelations. This argument, we admit, would be decisive if
its allegations were indisputable. It is curious, however, that
the one <i>locus classicus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> from which is inferred the presbyter's
repudiation of the Apocalypse, is confessedly ambiguous; and
the charge it prefers against Cerinthus may amount to either
of these two propositions; that he had composed the Book of
Revelations and palmed it on the world as the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the Apostle John; or, that he had given himself the air of a
great Apostle, and published accordingly some revelations
affecting to be imparted, like those of John, by angels. According
to this last interpretation, the work of Cerinthus
would be a book distinct from our Apocalypse, written in
imitation of it, and seeking to share its authority. The contents
of the production are briefly described by Caius; but
they present such a mixture of agreement and disagreement
with our canonical book, as to leave the ambiguity unresolved.
They affirm, that after the resurrection will follow an earthly
kingdom of Christ, in which the lower nature of man will, in
Jerusalem, be again in servitude to passion and pleasure;
and that the number of a thousand years are to be spent in
the indulgence of sense. So far as the <i>place</i> and the <i>duration</i>
of the kingdom are concerned, our Apocalypse might here be
referred to; but it has nothing answering to the description
of a gross and luxurious millennium. Taking the passage in
conjunction with the similar statement of Theodoret, that
"Cerinthus invented certain revelations, pretending that they
were given in vision to himself," we think it unlikely that our
Apocalypse can be meant; and conceive the indictment to be,
that Cerinthus had put forth a set of apocryphal visions, in
which he abused the style and corrupted the teachings of a
great Apostle to the purposes of a sensual fanaticism. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
is a charge which Caius might bring, in consistency with the
fullest acceptance of the Apocalypse as authentic and true.
It was not the doctrine of a reign of Christ on earth, not the
millenarian period assigned to it, to which he objected in
Cerinthus; but the coarse and demoralizing picture given of
its employments and delights. In proportion to his respect
for the real Apocalypse and its teachings, would he be likely to
resent such a miserable parody on its lofty theocratic visions.
His opposition to the Montanists in no way pledged him to
renounce the eschatological expectations which they were distinguished
from other Christians not by entertaining, but by
exaggerating. If our work, in its notice of their heresy,
passes by in silence this particular element of the system,
and treats their claim to special gifts of prophecy with less
contemptuous emphasis than might be looked for in the antagonist
of Proclus, there is nothing that ought really to surprise
us in this. It does not follow that, because in our scanty
knowledge we have only one idea about an historical personage,
the man himself never had another. Caius did not live
in a perpetual platform disputation with Proclus; and either
before that controversy had waked him up, or after it was
well got over, he might naturally enough dismiss the Montanists
with very cursory notice; in the one case, because
they had not yet adequately provoked his antipathy; in the
other, because they had already had enough of it.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Nothing therefore presents itself in our work which should
deter us from attributing it to Caius; and the more we ponder
the evidence, the more do we incline to believe it his. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
result is to us an unwelcome one; both because we know how
strong the presumption must be against a critical judgment
condemned by the masterly genius of M. Bunsen, and because
he has really made us in love with his ecclesiastical hero,&mdash;has
put such an innocent and venerable life into that old effigy,
that after wandering with him about the quays of Portus, and
entering with listening fancy into the Basilica<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> where he
preached, it is hard to return him into stone, and think of him
only as a dead bishop who made a bad almanac. Should our
readers have contracted no such ideal attachment, we fear that
this discussion of authorship may appear as trivial as it is
tedious. Somebody wrote the "Philosophumena," and whether
we call him Hippolytus or Caius, whether we lodge him
on the Tiber within sight of the <i>Pharos</i>, or of the <i>Milliarium
Aureum</i>, may seem a thing indifferent, so long as the elements
of the personal image do not materially change. This utilitarian
impression is by no means just, and indeed is at variance
with all true historical feeling. But it is time that we should
give it its fair rights, and turn from the name upon our new
book to its substances and significance.</p>

<p>Many sensible persons are at a loss, we believe, to understand
why this refutation of thirty-two extinct heresies should
be regarded with so much interest. Is it so well done, then?
they ask. Far from it: better books are brought out every
year; and such a controversial argument offered in manuscript
to Mr. Longman or Mr. Parker to-morrow, would hardly
be deemed worth the cost of printing. Does it add materially
to our knowledge of the early heresies? Something of
this kind it certainly contributes; but the gain is not large,
and will make no essential change in the conclusions of any
competent historical inquirer. Is any light thrown by it on
the authenticity of our canonical books? This can hardly be
expected from a production of the third century; and M.
Bunsen's application of it to this purpose appears to us, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
reasons which we shall assign, extremely precarious. Perhaps
it supplies the want which every student of that period
must have felt, and organically joins ecclesiastical to civil history,
so that they no longer remain apart,&mdash;the one as the
stage for saints and martyrs, bishops and books, the other for
soldiers and senators, emperors and paramours,&mdash;but mingle
in the common life of humanity. When we think how
the author was placed, it is impossible not to go to him with
an eager hope of this nature. He lived at the centre of the
vast Roman world, and felt all the pulsations and paroxysms
of that mighty heart. He witnessed the ominous decline of
every traditional maxim and national reverence in favor of
imported superstitions and degenerate barbarities. Under
Commodus he saw the ancient Mars superseded by the Grecian
Hercules, and Hercules represented by an emperor who
sunk into a prize-fighter, and the administration of the empire
in the wanton hands of a Phrygian slave, who was only less
brutal than his master. In the midst of pestilence, which had
become chronic in Italy from the time of M. Antoninus, and
of which a Christian bishop could not but know more than
others, the city was still adding to its semblance of splendor
and salubrity; and the magnificent baths and grounds that
were opened to the public service at the Porta Capena, with
the multiplied festivities and donatives, attested how little
mere physical attention to the people can arrest the miseries
of a moral degradation. Nor could the Christians of that
age be wholly without insight into the habits of the highest
class in Rome, for, in that great <i>colluvies</i> of heterogeneous
faiths, the caprice of taste, if not some better impulse, determined
now and then an inmate of the palace to favor the religion
of Christ; and the favorite mistress of Commodus, who
ruled him while she could, and then had him drugged and
strangled in his sleep, is the very Marcia whom our presbyter
describes as φιλοθεος and at whose intervention the Christian
exiles were released from their banishment in Sardinia. If he
was at home when the excellent Pertinax was murdered, and
cared to know what tyrant was to have the world instead, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was perhaps in the throng that ran to the Quirinal, and heard
the Prætorians shout from their ramparts that the empire was
for sale, and saw the bargain with the foolish senator below,
who bought it with his money, and paid for it with his head.
Caius and his people had reason to tremble when they saw in
Septimius Severus not only the implacable conqueror who
suffered no political opponent to live, but the worshipper of
demons, the gloomy and fitful devotee of astrology and magic,
pliant only to sacerdotal hate; and when the young Origen
came to be their guest awhile, and told of the terror in Alexandria
which had joined his father to the band of martyrs, the
post that just then brought the news of the Emperor's death
in Britain would seem to take off a weight of fear; especially
as one son at least of the two inheritors of the empire had in
childhood been committed to a Christian nurse, and been said
to shrink and turn away from the savage spectacles of the amphitheatre.
They were doomed to be disappointed, if they
had placed any hope in Caracalla, and to find that what they
had taken in the boy for the nobleness of grace, was but the
timidity of nature; the murder, before his mother's face, of
his only brother, and then of his best counsellor, for refusing
to justify the fratricide, would soon make them ashamed of
remembering that he had ever heard the name of Christ. It
would be curious to know how the Christians comported themselves
when the Priest of the Sun became monarch of the
world, and seemed intent on dethroning every divinity to enrich
the homage to his own. The grand temple on the Palatine,
which he built for the god of Emesa, every passer-by
must have seen as it rose from its foundations. And when
the black stone was paraded on its chariot through the streets,
and the elder deities were compelled to leave their shrines
and attend in escort to the Eastern idol, or when the nuptials
were celebrated between the Syrian divinity and the goddess
of Carthage, and Baal-peor and Astarte succeeded to the honors
of Jove, no Christian presbyter could fail to witness the
gorgeous and humiliating procession,&mdash;renewed as it was
year by year,&mdash;or to ask himself into what deeper abomination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the city of the Scipios must sink, ere the catastrophe of
judgment made a sudden end. The orgies of Helagabalus
were more insulting to the elder Paganism of Rome than injurious
to the new faith, which equally detested both; and the
offended moral feeling of the city reacted perhaps in favor of
the Christian cause, and prepared the way for that more public
teaching of the religion, in buildings avowedly dedicated
to the purpose, which was first permitted in the succeeding
reign. The natural recoil in the imperial family itself from
the degradation of the court tended, perhaps, in the same direction,
and drove the astute Mamæa to seek, amid the universal
corruption, for some school of discipline which might save
the young Alexander Severus from the ignominy of her sister's
son. Whether from this motive, or from suspicion of the
growing force of Christianity as a social power, she had sent
for Origen, and had an interview with him at Antioch; and
the Roman disciples had reason to rejoice that her intellectual
impressions of their system should have been derived from
such a man, and her political estimate of it formed in the
East, where the crisis of conflict between the dying and the
living faiths was more advanced than in the West, and afforded
a less disguised augury of the result. From their fellow-believers
trading with the Levant, or arriving thence, the pastors
of the metropolis would learn the propitious temper of
the young Cæsar and his mother; and would feel no surprise,
when he succeeded to the palace of his cousin, that he not
only swept out the ministers of lust and luxury, but in his private
oratory enshrined, among the busts of Pagan benefactors,
the images also of Abraham and of Christ. They could not,
however, but observe how little the morals of the court and
the wisdom of the government could now avail to arrest the
progress of decay, and reach in detail the vices and miseries
of a degenerate state. When they passed the door of the
palace, they heard the public crier's voice proclaim, "Let only
purity and innocence enter here"; they visited a Christian
tradesman in a neighboring street, and found him just seized
by a nobleman whom he had dunned for an outstanding debt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
charged with magic or poisoning, doomed to pine in prison till
he gave release, and no redress or justice to be had. The Emperor
who, gazing in his chapel on the features of Christ, recognized
a religion human and universal, was the first under
whom a visible badge was put upon the slave, and a distinctive
servile dress adopted; the slave markets were still in consecrated
spots, the temple of Castor and the Via Sacra; and
if ever some captive Onesimus, recommended by letters from
the East to the brethren in Rome, was brought to the metropolis
for sale, thither must the deacon or the pastor go to find
how the auction disposes of their charge, and learn <i>which</i>
among the chalked feet it is that are "shod with the preparation
of the Gospel of peace." The commonwealth had
never boasted of so many great jurists as in the age of Papinian
and Paulus; but as the science of Law was perfected, the
power of Law declined; and Alexander Severus, the justest
of emperors, was unable to protect Ulpian, the greatest of
civilians, from military assassination in the palace itself, or to
punish the perpetrators of this outrage on popular feeling as
well as public right. The three days' tumult, in which this
master of jurisprudence fell the victim of Prætorian licentiousness,
our presbyter Caius must have witnessed; and
countless other momentous scenes, during a generation painfully
affluent in vicissitude, must have passed before his eyes;
and had he but known of what value his reports would be to
this age of ours, he would have said more of the life he saw,
and less of the speculations he denounced. To us it would
have been worth anything to know just what was too close to
him to catch his eye;&mdash;how the Christians lived in such a
world; what thoughts stirred in them as they walked the
streets and heard the news; what happened and was said
when they met together, and how this could adjust itself with
the real facts of an inconsistent and tyrannical present; and
how, as the corrupted State became ever more incapable of
vindicating moral ends, the rising Church undertook the secret
governance of life, and penetrated with its authority into recesses
beyond the reach, not of the arm of administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
only, but of the definitions of the widest code. But in this
respect also our author fails to realize our hopes. He gives
us a book of fancies rather than of facts, and instead of painting
existence, which is transient, and must be caught as it
flies, occupies himself in describing nonsense, which is always
to be had. The enormities of Helagabalus, though staring
him in the face, are nothing to him in comparison with heresy
in Lesser Asia, which keeps Easter on a wrong day. He is
shut up within the interior circle of the community of believers,
and gives but a single glimpse beyond; and builds for us
no bridge to abolish the mysterious separation of ecclesiastical
and ideal from civil and real existence in the early ages of
our faith. He is not peculiar in this defect. We all of us
live in the midst of history without knowing it, and ourselves
<i>make</i> history without feeling it; and that which will most
clearly paint us in the thought of other times, which will
seem our <i>power</i> to them, our romance and nobleness, with
which, therefore, they will most crave to satiate their eye, is
precisely what is least consciously present to us,&mdash;the natural
spirit and daily spring of our common being, through which
not the will of man, but the providence of God, works its appointed
ends. At all events, the insight which we should be
best pleased to gain into the life of the third century is not
given even incidentally, except in the scantiest measure, by
the "Philosophumena," which we must rank, in this respect,
below the Apologies, and with the writings of Irenæus and
Epiphanius. The book is dogmatic and controversial, and
the interest attached to it arises entirely from its being a <i>register
of opinion</i>, a new witness to the thoughts about divine
things, which the Christianity of its period owned and disowned.
For those who care at all to know the state of belief
a century before the Council of Nice, the work possesses a
high value. But the worth of this sort of information is itself
a thing disputed, at least its <i>religious</i> worth; and will be
very differently estimated, according to the preconception
which occupies us as to the nature of Divine Revelation, and
the sources open to us for the attainment of sacred truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Here it is that we find M. Bunsen's great and peculiar
strength. His religious philosophy, taken by itself, brings
us occasionally to a pause of doubt. His historical criticism
is not always convincing. But his doctrine of the <i>relation
between</i> religion and history, of the mingling of divine and
human elements in the theatre of time, and of the special
agency of Christianity in the spiritual education of mankind,
appears to us profoundly true and beautiful. This it is that
makes him attach so much importance to the creed of the
second and third centuries, and to the new light now thrown
upon it; an importance which, from every ordinary point of
view, can scarcely fail to appear fanciful and exaggerated.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic, for instance, entertains a conception
about what sacred truth is, and how it is to be had, which,
leaving nothing to depend on new discoveries, discharges all
the richest interest from any fresh knowledge we may gain of
religion in the past. With him divine truth, so far as it is
special to Christendom, is something wholly foreign to the
human mind, intrinsically unrelated to any faculty we have.
In being supernatural, it belongs to another sphere than that
to which our thought is restricted, and is totally withdrawn
from all the movements of our nature. It consists, indeed, in
a set of objective facts from which we are absent, and which
no ratiocination of ours can seize, any more than our ear can
tell whether there be music on Saturn's ring. There is no
human consciousness answering to it; and to resort thither for
it is like asking the dreamer or the blindfold to describe the
scene in which he stands, or consulting your own feelings to
learn what is going on in Pekin or Japan. On this theory,
the objects of faith are conceived of as objects of <i>perception</i>,
only by senses otherwise constituted than ours; we can have
no surmise about them, till they are announced to us by qualified
percipients, and no comprehension of them even then,
but only reception of them as facts imported for us from
abroad. The bearing of this doctrine of invisible realism on
the treatment of ecclesiastical history is manifest. The inaccessible
facts are deposited with the sacerdotal corporation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
with whom alone is vested the duty and the power of stating
and defining them. They are not indeed all stated and defined
in their last amplitude at once; for definition is always
an enclosure of the true by exclusion of the false; and it is
only in proportion as the dreaming perversity of men throws
forth one delusive fancy after another, that the Church draws
line after line to shut the intrusion out. If the creeds seem
to enlarge as the centuries pass, it is not that they have more
truth to give, but only more error to remove. The divine
facts were conceived aright and conceived complete in the
minds of Apostles and Evangelists, but they were not contemplated
then as <i>against</i> the follies and contradictions opposed to
them in later times; but as soon as the hour came for this
antagonism to be felt, the infallible perception secured in perpetuity
to the living hierarchy supplied the due verdict of rejection.
To the Catholic, therefore, Christianity was made
up and finished, its treasury was full, in the first generation;
its power of development is only the refusal of deviation;
and its intellectual life is tame as the story of some perfect
hero, who does nothing but stand still and repel temptations.
The history of doctrines thus becomes a history of heresies;
the primitive stock of tradition and Scripture must, on the one
hand, be maintained entire in the face of all possible exposures
by critical research; and, on the other, remain in eternal
barrenness and produce no more. Natural knowledge, whether
of the world or of humanity, may grow continually, but
the new thoughts it may lead us to entertain of God are either
<i>not</i> new, or not true; and every pretended enrichment of
truth is nothing but evolution of falsehood. This removal of
all variety from religion, this expulsion of life and change
into the negative region of aberration and denial, eviscerates
the past of its devout interest, rests the study of it on contempt
instead of reverence for man; with all its pious air, it
simply betrays history with a kiss, and delivers it over for
scribes to buffet and chief priests to crucify. Short work is
made in this way of any fresh witness, like the author of our
book, who turns up unexpectedly from an early age. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
he speak in agreement with the hierarchical standards? He
only flings another voice into the <i>consensus</i> of obedient believers.
Does he say anything at variance with the <i>regula fidei</i>?
Then have we only to see in what class of heretics he stands.
His testimony is either superfluous or misleading.</p>

<p>The Protestant, of the approved English type, arrives,
under guidance of a different thought, at the same flat and indifferent
result. Though he gives a more subjective character
to divine truth than the Roman Catholic, and brings both
the want and the supply of it more within the attestation of
consciousness, he puts its discovery equally beyond the reach
of our ruined faculties, and equally cuts it off from all relation
to philosophy and the natural living exercise of reason
and conscience. He further agrees that his foreign gift of
revelation was imported all at once, and all complete, into our
world, within the Apostolic age; that the conceptions of that
time are an authoritative rule for all succeeding centuries;
and that every newer doctrine is to be regarded as a false
accretion, to be flung off into the incompetent and barren
spaces of human speculation. He denies, however, the twofold
vehicle of this precious gift; and, cancelling altogether
the oral tradition and indeterminate Christian consciousness
of the early Church, shuts up the whole contents of religion
within the canonical Scriptures. The guardianship of unwritten
tradition being abolished, and the canon requiring no
guardianship at all, the trust deposited with the hierarchy
disappears; and no permanent inspiration, no authoritative
judicial function, in matters of faith, remains. Whatever
Holy Spirit continues in the Church is not a progressively
teaching spirit, which can ever impart thoughts or experiences
unknown to the first believers; but a personally comforting
and animating spirit, whose highest climax of enlightenment
is the exact reproduction of the primitive state of mind. The
apprehension of Divine truth is thus reduced to an affair of
verbal interpretation of documents; and though in this process
there is room for the largest play of subjective feeling,
so that different minds, different nations, different ages, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
unconsciously evolve very various results; these are not to
be regarded as possible Divine enrichments of the faith, but
to be brought rigidly to the standard of the earliest Church,
and disowned wherever they include what was absent there.
This view is less mischievous than the Roman Catholic, only
because it is more inconsequent and confused. The canon
which you take as sacred was selected and set in authority
by the unwritten consciousness and tradition which you reject
as profane. The Church existed before its records; expressed
its life in ways spreading indefinitely beyond them;
and neither was exempt from human elements till they were
finished, nor lost the Divine spirit when they were done. So
arbitrary a doctrine corrupts the beauty of Scripture, and
deadens the noblest interest of history. If the New Testament
is to serve as an infallible standard, it is thus committed
to perfect unity and self-consistency; and you are obliged to
contend that the various types of doctrine found within its
compass&mdash;the Messianic conceptions of Matthew and John,
the "Faith" of Paul and James, the eucharistic conceptions
of the first Evangelists and the last, the eschatology of the
Apocalypse and the Epistles&mdash;are only different sides of one
and the same belief, colored with the tints and shadings of
several minds. How utterly inadequate such an hypothesis
is to the explanation of the Scriptural phenomena, what a
distorted and absurd representation it gives of the sacred writers,
and their mode of thought, is best known to those who
have honestly tried to deal with the fourth Gospel, for instance,
as historically the supplement of the others, and dogmatically
of the Book of Revelation; to suppose the Logos-doctrine
tacitly present in the speeches of Peter; to detect the pre-existence
in Mark, or remove it from John; or to identify
the Paraclete with the gifts of Pentecost. All feeling of living
reality is lost from our picture of the Apostolic time, when
its outlines are thus blurred, its contrasts destroyed, its grouped
figures effaced, and the whole melted away by the persevering
drizzle of a watery criticism into a muddy glory round
the place where Christ should be. If, moreover, we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
find everything in the first age, then the second, and the
third, and all others, must be worse, just in so far as they differ
from it; and the whole course of succeeding thought, the
widening and deepening of the Christian faith and feeling, the
swelling of its stream by the lapse into it of Oriental Gnosis
and Hellenic Platonism and the Western Conscience, must
be a ceaseless degeneracy. Thus to the Bibliolater as to the
Romanist, Divine truth <i>has no history among men</i>, unless it be
the history of decline, or of recovery purchased by decline.
He also will accordingly care nothing about what the people
of Caius or Hippolytus thought. Is it in the Bible? If so,
he knew it before. Is it not in the Bible? Then he has nothing
to do with it but throw it away. By a fitting retribution,
this moping worship of the letter of a book and the creed
of a generation brings it to pass that both are lost to the mind
in a dismal haze of ignorance and misconception; and if the
"Evangelical" believer could be transported suddenly from
Exeter Hall into the company of the twelve in Jerusalem, or
the Proseucha which Paul enters on the banks of the Strymon,
or the room where the Agape is prepared at Rome, we
are persuaded that he would find a scene newer to his expectations
than by any other migration into a known time and
place.</p>

<p>But now let us abolish this isolation from the rest of human
existence of the <i>incunabula</i> of our faith, and throw open that
time to free relation with the whole providence of humanity.
Suppose Christianity to be the influence upon the world of a
Divine Person,&mdash;in quality divine, in quantity human,&mdash;whose
Epiphany was determined at a crisis of ripe conditions
for the rescue, the evolution, the spread of holy and sanctifying
truth. What are those conditions? They consist mainly
in the co-presence, within the embrace of one vast state, of
two opposite races or types of men, both having a partial gift
of divine apprehension, and holding in charge an indispensable
element of truth; both with their spiritual life verging to
exhaustion and capable of no separate effort more; and each
unconsciously pining away for want of the complement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
thought which the other only could supply. The <i>Hebrew</i>
brought his intense feeling of the Personality of God; conceiving
this in so concentrated a form as to exclude the proper
notion of infinitude, and render Him only the most powerful
Being in the Universe, its Monarch,&mdash;wielding the creatures
as his puppets,&mdash;acting historically upon its scenes as objective
to Him, and by the annals of his past agency supplying
to the Abrahamic family a religion of archives and documents.
The sovereignty of Jehovah raised him to an immeasurable
height above his creation; dwarfed all other existence; placed
him by <i>nature</i> at a distance from men, and only by <i>condescension</i>
allowing of approximation. And hence his worshippers,
in proportion as they adored his greatness, felt the littleness
of all else; acquired a temper towards their fellow-men,
if not severe and scornful, at least not reverent and tender;
and regarded them as separate in kind from Him, mere dust
on the balance or locusts in the field. The religion of the
<i>Hellenic</i> race began at the other end,&mdash;from the midst of
human life, its mysteries, its struggles, its nobleness, its mixture
of heroic Free-will and awful Destiny; and their deepest
reverence, their quickest recognition of the Divine, was directed
towards the soul of a man vindicating its grandeur,
though it should be against superhuman powers. In proportion
as men were great, beautiful, and good, did they appear
to be as lesser gods, and earth and heaven to be filled with
the same race. Thought, conscience, admiration in the human
mind were not personal accidents separately originating
in each individual; but the sympathetic response of our
common intellect, standing in front of Nature, to the kindred
life of the Divine intellect behind Nature, and ever passing
into expression through it. When this feeling of the Hellenic
race became reflective, and organized itself into philosophy, it
represented the universe as the eternal assumption of form by
the Divine thought, which we were enabled to read off by
our essential identity of nature. Hence a whole series of
conceptions quite different from the Hebrew representations;
instead of Creation, Evolution of being; instead of Interposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
from without, Incarnation operating from within; instead
of Omnipotent Will, Universal Thought; assigning as the
ideal of man's perfection, not so much obedience to Law, as
similitude of Mind to God; and tending predominantly not to
strength in Morals, but to beauty in Art. These two opposite
tendencies had run their separate course, and expended their
proper history; and were talking wildly, as in the approaching
delirium of death. But they are the two factors of all
religious truth: and to fuse them together, to make it impossible
that either should perish or should remain alone, the
Christ was given to the world, so singularly balanced between
them, that neither could resist his power, but both were drawn
into it for the regeneration of mankind. In the accidents of
his lot given to the one race, and only baffling the visions of
prophets to transcend them; in the essence of his nature, so
august and attractive to the other that the faith in Incarnation
was irresistible; presented to the Hebrews by his mortal
birth, and snatched from them by his immortal; stopping by
his holiness the mouth of Law, and carrying it up into the
higher region of Faith and Love; in the Temple wishing the
Temple gone, that there might be open communion, Spirit
with Spirit; translating sacrifice into self-sacrifice;&mdash;he had
every requisite for conciliating and blending the separated
elements of truth which, for so many ages, had been converging
towards him. But if this was the function providentially
assigned to him, and for which the divine and human were
so blended in him, it is a function which could not be accomplished
in a moment, in a generation, in a century. It is an
<i>historical</i> function, freely demanding time for its theatre; and
as the separate factors had occupied ages in attaining their
ripeness for combination, so must their fusion consume many
a lifetime of effervescing thought, ere the homogeneous truth
appeared. The words of Christ are not in this view the end
in which Revelation terminates; but the means given to us
of knowing himself, contributions to the picture we form of
his personality. Nor are the sentiments of his immediate
followers about his office and position in the scheme of Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
anything more authoritative to us than the incipient
attempts made, when his influence was fresh, to grasp the
whole of his relations while only a part was to be seen. The
records of the great crisis are no doubt of superlative value,
as the vehicles by which alone we understand and feel its
power; but their value is lost if they are to dictate truth to
our passive acceptance, instead of quickening our reason and
conscience to find it: they stop in this way the very development
which they were to lead, and disappoint Christ of the
very work he came to achieve. Human elements were inevitably
and fully present in the first age and its Scriptures,
as in every other; and the transitory ingredients they have
left, it is a duty to detach from the eternal truth. And as
conditions of finite imperfection cannot be banished from the
central era, neither can the guidance of the Infinite Spirit be
denied, whether among the Hebrew, the Hellenic, or the
Christian people, in the ages before and after. In that new
development of human consciousness and knowledge in regard
to God, which we call Christianity, <i>all</i> the requisite conditions&mdash;viz.
the factors taken up, the Person who blends them,
and the continuous product they evolve&mdash;include Divine
Inspiration as well as Human Reflection,&mdash;the living presence
and communion of the Eternal with the Transitory Mind,
of the perfectly Good with the good in the Imperfect. To
disengage the one from the other, to treasure up the true
and holy that is born of God, and let fall the false and wrong
that is infused by man, is possible only to Reason and Conscience,
is indeed the perpetual work in which they live; the
denial of which is not merely Atheism, but Devil-worship,&mdash;not
the bare negation, but the positive reversal, of religion,&mdash;the
virtual affirmation that God indeed <i>exists</i>, but exists as
<i>Un</i>-reason and <i>Un</i>-good. No mechanical, no chronological
separation can be effected of the Divine from the Human, the
Revealed from the Unrevealed, in faith; there is no person,
no book, no age, no Church, in which both do not meet, and
require to be disentangled the one from the other; but the
perseverance of God's living and self-harmonious Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
throughout the discordant errors of dying generations enables
the men most apt and faithful to his voice to know more and
more what his reality is, and drop the semblances by which
it is disguised. The effect of this view on our estimate of
ecclesiastical literature is evident. As, according to it, the
Apostolic period is not exempted from critical judgment, so
neither are succeeding times to be without their claim on religious
reverence. The canonical books of the New Testament
fall back into the general mass of literature recording
the earliest knowledge and consciousness of the disciples,
neither detached, as a mysterious whole, from other productions
of their time, nor excluding the greatest diversities of
value among themselves. They exhibit the first struggling
efforts&mdash;not always concurrent in their direction&mdash;of an
awakening spiritual life, to interpret a recent Divine manifestation,
and to solve by it the problem of the world's Providence.
Their very freshness and proximity to the great figure
of Christ was by no means an unmixed advantage to these
efforts; and they were not so complete and successful as to
supersede their continuance in the next and following generations,
which lay under no incompetency for their prosecution,
and are as likely, so far as antecedent probability goes, to
have enriched and improved, as to have impoverished and
spoiled, the earlier doctrine of Christ's relation to God and to
mankind. The chasm thus disappears between the Apostolic
age and its successor; the products of the first are not to be
accepted simply because they are there, nor those of the second
rejected because they are absent from the first; nor is
everything to be admitted on showing that it stands in both,
and even had a tenure long enough to become the prescriptive
occupant of the Church. The Catholic is right in clinging to
the continuous thread of Divine Inspiration binding the centuries
of Christendom together; and in maintaining that the
expression of true doctrine grows fuller with time. He is
wrong in making the Spirit over to an hierarchical corporation;
and in treating the ostensible growth of doctrine as the
mere negation of heresies. The Protestant is right in rescuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
from the haze of uncertain tradition the real historical
ground of his religion, and setting it in the focus of an intense
reverence; and in rejecting whatever cannot be adjusted with
the clear facts and essential Spirit of that primitive Gospel.
He is wrong in his insulation of that time as a sole authoritative
age of golden days, in which the faith had neither error
nor defect, and from which it must be copied, with daguerreotype
exactitude, into every disciple's mind. Keep the positive
elements, destroy the negative limitations of both these systems,
and the true conception of Christianity emerges. As a
system of self-conscious doctrine, it is a religious Philosophy,
starting from the historical appearance of Christ as an expression
of God in human life, and always detained around
this one object as its centre; and in its development consulting
not the idiosyncrasies and conceits of private and personal
reflection, but the devout consciousness and spiritual <i>consensus</i>
of all Christian ages and all holy men. All religion is the
product of an action of the Infinite mind upon the finite: in
the <i>Christian</i> religion that action takes place upon souls engaged
in the contemplation of Christ as the manifestation of
God's moral nature. This given object remaining the same,
there is room for indefinite expansion and variety; and every
developed form is to be tried, not by its date, but by the tests
of truth relevant to religious philosophy.</p>

<p>How far M. Bunsen would recognize his own doctrine in
this exposition we cannot say; but without intending in the
least to make him responsible for it, we think it does not essentially
deviate from his scheme of thought. The philosophical
aphorisms in which he has embodied his speculative faith
follow an order which we should have spoiled, had we, for our
present purpose, so brought them together as to make them
speak for themselves. And though they display the same
astonishing command of our language, in which the author
never fails, the cast of the thoughts is so Teutonic, that few
English readers, it is to be feared, will appreciate their depth
and richness. The complaint, which we have heard and seen,
that they are wholly unintelligible, is indeed purely ridiculous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
except that it sadly illustrates the extent to which reflection,
and even feeling, on such subjects has ceased in England. M.
Bunsen, we can assure our readers, knows what he means,
and lucidly states what he means; and those who miss his
meaning have for the most part no slight loss. The following
sentences, which the greatest sufferer from philosophobia may
drink in without convulsions, will explain his idea of Revelation,
in its bearing upon the use of written records. The
mere "Natural Religion" of the Deist, he observes, was&mdash;</p>

<p>"The negative reaction against the equally untenable, unphilosophical,
and irrational notion, that revelation was nothing
but an external historical act. Such a notion entirely
loses sight of the infinite or eternal factor of revelation, founded
both in the nature of the infinite and that of the finite
mind, of God and man.</p>

<p>"This heterodox notion became still more obnoxious, by its
imagining something higher in the manifestation of God's
will and being than the human mind, which is the divinely-appointed
organ of divine manifestation, and in a double manner;
ideally in mankind, as object, historically in the individual
man, as instrument.</p>

<p>"The notion of a merely historical revelation by written
records is as unhistorical as it is unintellectual and materialistic.
It necessarily leads to untruth in philosophy, to unreality
in religious thought, and to Fetichism in worship. It misunderstands
the process necessarily implied in every historical
representation. The form of expressing the manifestation of
God in the mind, as if God was himself using human speech
to man, and was thus himself finite and a man, is a form inherent
in the nature of human thought as embodied in language,
its own rational expression. It was originally never
meant to be understood materialistically, because the religious
consciousness which produced it was essentially spiritual;
and, indeed, it can only be thus misunderstood by those who
make it a rule and criterion of faith, never to connect any
thought whatever with what they are expected to believe as
divinely true.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every religion is positive. It is, therefore, justly called a
religion '<i>made manifest</i>' (offenbart), or, as the English term
has it, <i>revealed</i>; that is to say, it supposes an action of the infinite
mind, or God, upon the finite mind, or man, by which
God, in his relation to man, becomes manifest or visible.
This can be mediate, through the manifestation of God in the
Universe of Nature; or a direct, immediate action, through
the religious consciousness.</p>

<p>"This second action is called <i>revealed</i>, in the strictest sense.
The more a religion manifests of the real substance and nature
of God, and of his relation to the universe and to man,
the more it deserves the name of a divine manifestation, or of
Revelation. But no religion which exists could exist without
something of truth, revealed to man, through the creation,
and through his mind.</p>

<p>"Such a direct communication of the Divine mind as is
called Revelation has necessarily two factors, which are unitedly
working in producing it. The one is the infinite factor,
or the direct manifestation of eternal truth to the mind, by
the power which that mind has of perceiving it; for human
perception is the correlate of divine manifestation. There
could be no revelation of God if there was not the corresponding
faculty in the human mind to receive it, as there is
no manifestation of light where there is no eye to see it.</p>

<p>"This infinite factor is, of course, not historical; it is inherent
in every individual soul, only with an immense difference
in the degree.</p>

<p>"The action of the Infinite upon the mind, is <i>the</i> miracle of
history and of religion, equal to the miracle of creation.</p>

<p>"Miracle, in its highest sense, is therefore essentially and
undoubtedly an operation of the Divine mind upon the human
mind. By that action the human mind becomes inspired with
a new life, which cannot be explained by any precedent of the
selfish (natural) life, but is its absolute contrary. This miracle
requires no proof; the existence and action of religious
life is its proof, as the world is the proof of creation.</p>

<p>"The second factor of revelation is the finite or external.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
This means of divine manifestation is, in the first place, a universal
one, the Universe or Nature. But, in a more special
sense, it is a historical manifestation of divine truth through
the life and teaching of higher minds among men. These
men of God are eminent individuals, who communicate something
of eternal truth to their brethren; and, as far as they
themselves are true, they have in them the conviction, that
what they say and teach of things divine is an objective truth.
They therefore firmly believe that it is independent of their
individual personal opinion and impression, and will last, and
not perish, as their personal existence upon earth must.</p>

<p>"The difference between Christ and other men of God is
analogous to that between the manifestation of a part, and of
the totality and substance, of the divine mind."&mdash;Vol. II. p.
60, <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>The newly-found work, like other productions of the same
period, can have only a disturbing interest for the Roman
Catholic and Orthodox Protestant. For, in conjunction with
previous evidence, it shows that the unbroken unity of teaching
is altogether a fiction; that what afterwards became heresy
was, in the latter part of the second century, held in the
church of the primacy itself, and by successors of St. Peter;
that the clergy of Rome, so far from owning the apostolic authority
of their chief, could resist him as heterodox; and that
the contents of the Catholic system, far from appearing as an
invariable whole from the first, were a gradual synthesis of
elements flowing in from new channels of influence brought
into connection with the faith; and as against the approved
type of Protestant, it shows that his favorite scheme of dogma
was still in a very unripe state, and that further back it
had been still more so; so that if he binds himself to the earliest
creed, he may probably have to accept a profession
which he hardly regards as Christian at all. But from the
third point of view, which assumes that development is an inherent
necessity in a revelation, and may add to its truth, instead
of subtracting from it, the monuments of Christian literature
from the secondary period have a positive interest, free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
from all uneasiness and alarm. They arrest for us, in the
midst, the advance of theological belief towards the form ultimately
recognized in the Church, and expressed in the established
creeds; they render visible the beautiful features and
expanded look of the faith, when its Judaic blood had been
cooled by the waters of an Hellenic baptism; and though
they leave many undetermined problems as to the successive
steps by which the original Hebrew type of the Gospel in Jerusalem
was metamorphosed into the Nicene and hierarchical
Christianity, they fix some intermediate points, and make us
profoundly conscious of the greatness of the change.</p>

<p>The author of the "Philosophumena," for instance, would
be stopped at the threshold of every sect in our own country,
and excluded as heterodox. He crosses the lines of our theological
definitions, and trespasses on forbidden ground, in
every possible doctrinal direction. Cardinal Wiseman would
have nothing to say to him; for he is insubordinate to the
"Vicar of Christ," and profanely insists that a pope may be
deposed by his own council of presbyters. The Bishop of
Exeter would refuse him institution; for his Trinity is imperfect,
and he allows no Personality to the Holy Ghost. The
Archbishop of Dublin might probably think him a little hard
upon Sabellius; but, if he would quietly sign the Articles,
(which, however, he could by no means do,) might abstain
from retaliation, and let him pass. At Manchester, Canon
Stowell would keep him in hot water for his respectable opinion
of human nature, and his lofty doctrine of free-will. In
Edinburgh, Dr. Candlish would not listen to a man who had
nothing to say of reliance on the imputed merits of Christ.
The sapient board at New College, St. John's Wood, would
expel him for his loose notions of Inspiration. And the Unitarians
would find him too transcendental, make no common
sense out of his notions of Incarnation, and recommend
him to try Germany. This fact, that a bishop of the second
and third centuries would be ecclesiastically not a stranger
only, but an outcast among us, is most startling; and ought
surely to open the eyes of modern Christians to the false and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
dangerous position into which their churches have been brought
by narrow-heartedness and insincerity. It will not be M.
Bunsen's fault if our Churchmen remain insensible to the
national peril and disgrace of maintaining unreformed a system
long known to have no heart of modern reality, and now
seen to have as little ground of ancient authority. Again
and again he raises his voice of earnest and affectionate warning.
As a foreigner domesticated among us, as a scholar of
wide historical view, as a philosophical statesman who, amid
the diplomacy of the hour, descends to the springs of perennial
life in nations, as a Christian who profoundly trusts the
reality of religion, and cannot be dazzled by the pretence, he
sees, with a rare clearness and breadth, both the capabilities
and the dangers of our social and spiritual condition. He
sees that God has given to the English people a moral massiveness
and veracity of character which presents the grandest
basis of noble faith; while learned selfishness and aristocratic
apathy uphold in the Church creeds which only stupidity
can sign without mental reservations,&mdash;a Liturgy that
catches the scruple of the intellectual without touching the
enthusiasm of the popular heart,&mdash;a laity without function,&mdash;a
clergy without unity,&mdash;and a hierarchy without power.
He sees that our insular position has imparted to us a distinctive
nationality of feeling, supplying copious elements for coalescence
in a common religion; while obstinate conservatism
has permitted our Christianity to become our great divisive
power, and to disintegrate us through and through. He respects
our free institutions, which sustain the health of our
political life; but beside them he finds an ecclesiastical system
either imposed by a dead and inflexible necessity, or left
unguided to a whimsical voluntaryism, which separates the
combinations of faith from the relations of neighborhood, of
municipality, of country. With noble and richly-endowed
universities at the exclusive disposal of the Church, he finds
the theological and philosophical sciences so shamefully neglected,
that Christian faith notoriously does not hold its intellectual
ground, and in its retreat does nothing to reach a firmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
position; but only protests its resolution to stand still, and
raise a din against the critic or metaphysic host that drives it
back. Is there no one in this great and honest country that
has trust enough in God and truth, foresight enough of ruin
from falsehood and pretence, to lay the first hand to the work
of renovation? Is statesmanship so infected with negligent
contempt of mankind, that no high-minded politician can be
found to care for the highest discipline of the people, and reorganize
the institutions in which their conscience, their reason,
their upward aspirations, should find life? Has the
Church no prophet with faith enough to fling aside creed and
college, and fire within him to burn away mediæval pedantries,
and demand an altar of veracity, that may bring us together
for common work and "common prayer"? Or is it to be left
to the <i>strong men</i>, exulting in their strength, and storming
with the furor of honest discontent, to settle these matters
with the sledge-hammer of their indignation? Miserable
hypocrisy! to open the lips and lift the eyes to heaven, while
beckoning with the finger of apathy to these pioneers of Necessity!
Would that some might be found to lay to heart
our author's warning and counsel in the following sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>"While we exclude all suggestions of despair, as being
equally unworthy of a man and of a Christian, we establish
two safe principles. The first is, that, in all congregational
and ecclesiastical institutions, Christian freedom, within limits
conformable to Scripture, constitutes the first requisite for a
vital restoration. The second fundamental principle is, that
every Church must hold fast what she already possesses, in so
far as it presents itself to her consciousness as true and efficacious.
In virtue of the first condition, she will combine
Reason and Scripture in due proportions; by virtue of the
second, she will distinguish between Spirit and Letter, between
Idea and Form. No external clerical forms and mediæval
reflexes of bygone social and intellectual conditions
can save us, nor can sectarian schisms and isolation from
national life. Neither can learned speculations, and still less
the incomparably more arrogant dreams of the unlearned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Scientific consciousness must dive into real life, and refresh
itself in the feelings of the people, and that no one will be
able to do without having made himself thoroughly conversant
with the sufferings and the sorrows of the lowest classes
of society. For out of the feeling of these sufferings and
sorrows, as being to a great degree the most extensive and
most deep-seated product of evil,&mdash;that is, of selfishness,&mdash;arose,
eighteen hundred years ago, the divine birth of Christianity.
The new birth, however, requires new pangs of labor,
and not only on the part of individuals, but of the whole nation,
in so far as she bears within her the germs of future life,
and possesses the strength to bring forth. Every nation must
set about the work herself, not, indeed, as her own especial
exclusive concern, but as the interest of all mankind. Every
people has the vocation to coin for itself the divine form of
Humanity, in the Church as well as in the State; its life depends
on this being done, not its reputation merely; it is the
condition of existence, not merely of prosperity.</p>

<p>"Is it not time, in truth, to withdraw the veil from our misery?
to point to the clouds which rise from all quarters, to
the noxious vapors which have already well-nigh suffocated
us? to tear off the mask from hypocrisy, and destroy that
sham which is undermining all real ground beneath our feet?
to point out the dangers which surround, nay, threaten already
to engulf us? Is the state of things satisfactory in a Christian
sense, where so much that is unchristian predominates,
and where Christianity has scarcely begun here and there to
penetrate the surface of the common life? Shall we be satisfied
with the increased outward respect paid to Christianity
and the Church? Shall we take it as a sign of renewed life,
that the names of God and Christ have become the fashion,
and are used as a party badge? Can a society be said to be
in a healthy condition, in which material and selfish interests
in individuals, as well as in the masses, gain every day more
and more the upper hand? in which so many thinking and
educated men are attached to Christianity only by outward
forms, maintained either by despotic power, or by a not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
despotic, half-superstitious, half-hypocritical custom? when
so many churches are empty, and satisfy but few, or display
more and more outward ceremonials and vicarious rites?
when a godless schism has sprung up between spirit and
form, or has even been preached up as a means of rescue?
when gross ignorance or confused knowledge, cold indifference
or the fanaticism of superstition, prevails as to the understanding
of Holy Scripture, as to the history, nay, the fundamental
ideas of Christianity? when force invokes religion
in order to command, and demagogues appeal to the religious
element in order to destroy? when, after all their severe
chastisements and bloody lessons, most statesmen base their
wisdom only on the contempt of mankind? and when the
prophets of the people preach a liberty, the basis of which is
selfishness, the object libertinism, and the wages are vice?
And this in an age the events of which show more and more
fatal symptoms, and in which a cry of ardent longing pervades
the people, re-echoed by a thousand voices!"&mdash;III. <span class="smcap">xv</span>.</p>

<p>Sorry, however, as we should be to see our Roman presbyter
disconsolately wandering from fold to fold in modern
England, and dismissed as a black sheep from all, we should
not like to find him metamorphosed into chief shepherd either,
and invested with the guidance of our ecclesiastical affairs.
Though he is above imitating the feeble railing of Irenæus at
the heresies, he deals with them in the true clerical style;
often missing their real meaning, he does not spare them his
bad word; and fancies he has killed them before he has even
caught them. He has an evident relish also for a tale of
scandal, as a make-weight against a theological opponent. In
the "Little Labyrinth," he had told us a story about a Unitarian
minister, who, for accepting his schismatical office, had
been horsewhipped by angels all night; so that he crawled in
the morning to the metropolitan, and gave in his penitential
recantation. And now, in the larger work, the author flies at
higher game, and makes out that Pope Callistus was an incorrigible
scamp; originally a slave in the household of a
wealthy Christian master, Carpophorus, whose confidence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
abused in every possible way. First, having been intrusted
with the management of a bank in the <i>Piscina publica</i>, he
swindled and ruined the depositors, and decamped, with the
intention of sailing from Portus, but was found on board ship;
and, though he jumped into the sea to avoid capture, was
picked up, and condemned by his master to the hand-mill.
Next, being allowed to go out, on the plea of collecting some
debts which would enable him to pay a dividend to the depositors,
he created a riot in a Jews' synagogue, and, being
brought before the prefect, was sentenced to be flogged and
transported to Sardinia. Thence he escaped by passing himself
off among a number of Christians, released from their
exile through the influence of the Emperor's concubine, Marcia,
and on the recommendation of Victor, the Pope. As he
was not included in the list of pardons, he no sooner made his
appearance in Rome than his master sent him off to live on a
monthly allowance at Antium. On the death of Carpophorus,
he seems to have attained his freedom by bequest; and his
fertility of resource having made him useful to the new Pope
Zephyrinus, he acquired influence enough to succeed him in
the Primacy. We must confess that the evident <i>gusto</i> with
which our presbyter tells this scandal, the <i>animus</i> with which
he accuses Zephyrinus also of stupidity and venality, and the
predominance in his narrative of theological antipathy over
moral disgust, leave a painful impression on the reader respecting
the spirit then at work in the Apostolic See. And
though his scheme of belief, especially in relation to the person
of Christ, was more rational than the definitions of more
modern creeds, yet we fear that he would be not less nice
about its shape, and intolerant of those who move about in
freer folds of thought, than a divine of the Canterbury cloisters
or the Edinburgh platform. His quarrel with the two
popes whom he abuses shows pretty clearly the stage of development
which the Christian theology had then reached.
On this matter we must say a few words.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the precise order of combination
which brought the Hebrew and Hellenic ideas of God into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
union, there can be no doubt about the two <i>termini</i> of the process.
It started from the monarchical conception of Jehovah,
as a Unity without plurality; and it issued in the Athanasian
Trinity, with its three hypostases in one essence. Of these,
the Father expressed the Absolute existence, the Son the
Objective manifestation, the Holy Spirit the Subjective revelation
of God. In the presbyter's creed, the third term was
not yet incorporated, but still floated freely, diffused and impersonal.
Leaving this out of view, we may observe, in the
remaining part of the doctrine, two principal difficulties to be
surmounted, arising from the double medium of divine objective
manifestation,&mdash;Nature, always proceeding,&mdash;and Christ,
historically transient. The first problem is, How to pass at
all out of the Infinite existence into Finite phenomena, and
conceive the relation between the Father and the Son; the
second, How to pass from Eternal manifestation through all
phenomena into temporary appearance in an Individual, so as
to conceive the relation between the Son and the Galilean
Christ. Thus, excluding all reference to the Holy Spirit,
there were, in fact, <i>four</i> objects of thought, whose relations
to one another were to be adjusted; viz. the Father, the Son
evolving all things, the Christ or divine individualization in the
Gospel, and Jesus of Nazareth, the human being with whose
life this individualization concurred. Among all these there
were, so to speak, two clearly distinct Wills to dispose of;
that of the man Jesus at the lowest extremity, and that of the
Supreme God, which the Jew, at least, would fix at the upper.
These two Wills act, in the whole development of doctrine
on this subject, as the secret centres of Personality; and the
remaining elements obtain or miss a hypostatic character according
as they are drawn or not into coalescence with the
one or the other. The volitional point of the Divine Agency
being once determined, it may be regarded as enclosed between
the <i>Thought</i>, or intellectual essence out of which it
comes, and the <i>Execution</i> by which it is realized; or it may
be left undistinguished from these, and may be made to coincide
with either. According to these variable conditions arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the several modes of doctrine in reference to the Divine element
in God's Objective manifestation. The differences, for
instance, between our presbyter's doctrine and Origen's, will
be found to depend on the different points which they seize as
the seat of divine volition, and the germ of their logical development.
Our author, exemplifying the Hebrew tendency,
seeks his initiative up at the fountain-head, and puts himself
back before the first act of creation; he starts from the One
God, with whom nothing was co-present, and fixes in Him the
seat of the primeval Will. There, however, it would remain,
a mere potentiality, did not the Eternal Mind, by reflection in
itself, pass into self-consciousness, and give objectivity to its
own thought. This primary expression of his essence, in
which it enters into relation, but relation only to itself, is the
<i>Logos</i>, or <i>Son</i> of God, the agent in the production of all
things. The potentiality is thus reserved to the Father; the
effectuation is given to the Son; who, coming in at a point
lower down than the seat of Will, and simply bridging over
the interval that leads to accomplishment, is felt without the
essential condition of a numerically distinct subsistence; and
has either the instrumental and subordinate personality of a
dependent being, or is imperfectly hypostatized.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In this impersonal
character does the Logos manifest the Divine thought
in the visible universe; in the minds of godly men, which are
the source of law; in the glance of prophets, which catches
and interprets the divine significance of all times; and first
assumes a full personality in the Incarnation. Having left
the primary Will behind in the Father's essence, the Logos
remains but an inchoate hypostasis, till alighting, in the human
nature, on another centre of volition. As if our author were
half conscious, in reaching this point, of relief from an antecedent
uneasiness, he now holds fast to the personality which
has been realized, represents it as not dissolved by the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on the cross, but taken up into heaven, and abiding for ever.
It is, in this view, the two extreme terms that supply the hypostatizing
power; of the others, the Logos has no personality
but by looking back to the Father; nor the Christ, but by
going forward to the Son of Mary. This shows the yet powerful
influence of the Judaic Monarchianism, and the embarrassment
of a mind, setting out from that type of faith, to
provide any plurality within the essence of God. Origen, on
the other hand, yielded to the Hellenic feeling, and, instead of
going back to any absolute commencement, looked for his
Divine centre and starting-point further down; and took
thence whatever upward glance was needful to complete his
view. As the Greek reverence was not touched but by the
Divine embodied in concrete life and form, so the Alexandrine
catechist instinctively fixed upon the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, the objective
Thought of God, proceeding, not once upon a time or ever
<i>first</i>, but <i>eternally</i>, from Him, as the initiative position for his
doctrine. Here was placed the clearest and intensest focus of
Will; and only in this ever-evolving efficient were the full
conditions of personality realized. The Father was conceived
more pantheistically, as the universal νους, the intellectual
background, whence issued the acting nature of the Son. In
meditating on them in their conjunction, Origen would think
of the relation between <i>thought</i> and <i>volition</i>; our author, of
that between <i>volition</i> and <i>execution</i>. Both doctrines show
the imperfect fusion of Hebrew and Hellenic elements, and
illustrate the characteristic effect of an excessive proportion of
each. Where the Hebrew element prevails, the personality
of the Son is endangered; where the Hellenic, the personality
of the Father. Even our presbyter's doctrine of the Son,
however, gave too strong an impersonation to Him for the
party in Rome who sided with Zephyrinus and Callistus.
These popes accused him, it seems, of being a <i>Ditheist</i>; and
themselves maintained that the terms Father and Son denoted
only different sides and relations of one and the same Being,&mdash;nay,
not only of the same Being, but of the same προσωπον;
and that the spirit that dwelt in Christ was the Father, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
whom all things are full. For this opinion the two popes are
angrily dealt with by our author, and charged with being half
Sabellian, half humanitarian. His rancor justifies the suspicion,
that, though he represents the party which triumphed
at Rome, his opponents had been numerous and powerful, as,
indeed, their election to the primacy would of itself show, and
that even his own imperfect dogma was superinduced, not
without a protracted struggle, upon an earlier faith yet remote
from the Nicene standard.</p>

<p>And this brings us at once to a question of historical research,
which, though far too intricate and extensive to be discussed
here, we feel bound to notice, as far as it is affected by
the newly discovered work. How long did it take for the
Christian faith to assume the leading features of its orthodox
and catholic form, and especially to work itself clear of Judaism?
It is an acknowledged fact, that the earliest disciples,
including at the lowest estimate all the converts of the first
seven years from the ascension, not only were born Hebrews,
but did not regard their baptism as in any way withdrawing
them from the pale of their national religion; that, on the contrary,
they claimed to be the only true Jews, differing from
others simply by their belief in a personally appointed, instead
of a vaguely promised Messiah; that they aimed at no
more than to bring over their own race to this conviction, and
persuade them that the national destinies were about to be
consummated, and, so far from relaxing the obligations of
their Law, adhered with peculiar rigor to its ritual and its
exclusiveness. So long as none but the twelve Apostles had
charge of its diffusion, Christianity was only a particular mode
of Judaism, and its whole discussion a ζητησις των Ιουδαιων.
It is further admitted, that the first inroad upon this narrowness
was made by St. Paul, who insisted on the universality
of Christ's function, and the abrogation of the Mosaic Law in
favor of inward faith, as the condition of union with God.
Nor, again, is it denied that this freer view met with great
resistance, and that its conflict with the other, apparent throughout
the Pauline Epistles, formed the most animating feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of the Apostolic age. During that period, two distinct parties,
and two separate lines of development and growth, may be
traced; one following out in morals the <i>legal</i> idea into asceticism,
voluntary poverty, and physical purity, and in faith the
<i>monarchian</i> idea into theocratic and millenarian expectations;
the other, proceeding from the notion of <i>faith</i> to substitute an
ideal Christ for the historical, a new religion for an old law,
the free embrace of divine reconciliation for the anxious strain
of self-mortifying obedience. But how long did this struggle
and separation continue? According to the prevalent belief,
it was all over in a few years; and, by the happy harmony
and concurrence of the Apostles, was determined in favor of
the generous Pauline doctrine; so that St. John lived to see
the Hebrew Christians sink into a mere Ebionitish sect outside
the pale, and their stiff Unitarian theology disowned in
favor of the higher teachings of his Gospel. Against this
assumption of so easy a victory over the Jewish tendency,
several striking testimonies have often been urged. Tertullian,
in a well-known passage of his treatise against Praxeas,
describes the dislike with which the unlearned majority of
believers regard the Trinitarian distinctions in the Godhead,
and the zeal with which they cry out for holding to "the
Monarchy."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In the time of Pope Zephyrinus, as we learn
from Eusebius, a body of Unitarians in Rome, followers of
Artemon, defended their doctrine by the conservative plea of
antiquity and general consent; affirming that it was no other
than the uninterrupted creed of the Roman Church down to
the time of Victor, the preceding pope; and that the higher
doctrine of the Person of Christ was quite a recent innovation.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Nor are we without ecclesiastical literature, of even a
later date, that by its theological tone gives witness to the
same effect. The "Clementine Recognitions," written somewhere
between 212 and 230, occupy a dogmatic position,
higher indeed than the disciples of Artemon, but only in the
direction of Arius, and, to save the Unity of God, deny the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Deity of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Relying on such evidence as this, Priestley,
in his "History of Early Opinions," and his controversy with
Bishop Horsley, maintained that the creed of the Church for
the first two centuries was Unitarian. But this position was
attended with many difficulties, so long as the present canonical
Scriptures were allowed to have been in the hands of the
Christians of that period, and recognized as authorities; for
the narratives of the miraculous conception, the writings of
Paul, and the Gospel of John, are irreconcilable with the
schemes of belief attributed to the early Unitarians. Moreover,
if for two centuries the Church had interpreted its
authoritative documents in one way, and formed on this its
services and expositions, it is not easy to conceive the rapid
revolution into another. During a period of free and floating
tradition, there is manifest room for the growth of essentially
different modes of faith; but after the reception of a definite
set of sacred books, the scope for change is much contracted.
To treat the doctrine of the Logos as an innovation, yet ascribe
the fourth Gospel to the beloved disciple; to suppose
that justification by works was the generally received notion
among people who guided themselves by the authority of Paul,&mdash;involves
us in irremediable contradictions. Avoiding these
at least, possibly not without the risk of others, the celebrated
theologians of Tübingen have maintained a bolder thesis than
that of Priestley, including it indeed, but with it also a vast
deal more. Their theory runs as follows. The opposition
which St. Paul's teaching excited, and of which his letters
preserve so many traces, was neither so insignificant nor so
short-lived as is commonly supposed; but was encouraged
and led by the other Apostles, especially James and John and
Peter, who never heartily recognized the volunteer Apostle;
and was so completely successful, that he died without having
made any considerable impression on the Judaic Christianity
sanctioned from Jerusalem. Accordingly, the earliest Christian
literature was Ebionitish; and no production was in higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
esteem than the "Gospel of the Hebrews," which, after being
long current, with several variations of form, at last settled
down into our Gospel of Matthew. In almost all the writings
known to us, even in Roman circles of the second century,&mdash;the
Shepherd of Hermas, the Memorials of Hegesippus,
the works of Justin,&mdash;some character or other of
Ebionitism is present,&mdash;millenarian doctrine, admiration of
celibacy and of abstinence from meat and wine, denunciation
of riches, emphatic assertion of the <i>Messiahship</i> of Jesus, and
treatment of the miraculous conception as at least an open
question. The labors of Paul, however, had left a seed which
had been buried, but not killed; and from the first, a small
party had cherished his freer principles, and sought to win
acceptance for them; and as the progress of time increased
the proportion of provincial and Gentile converts, and the
Jewish wars of Titus and Hadrian destroyed the possibility
of Mosaic obedience and the reasonableness of Hebrew hopes,
the Pauline element rose in magnitude and importance.
Thus the two courses of opposite development ran parallel
with each other, and gradually found their interest in mutual
recognition and concession. Hence, a series of writings proceeding
from either side, first of conciliatory approximation
only, next of complete neutrality and equipoise, in which
sometimes the figures of Peter and Paul themselves are presented
with studiously balanced honor, at others their characteristic
ideas are adjusted by compromise. The Clementine
Homilies, the Apostolic Constitutions, the Epistle of James,
the Second Epistle of Clement, the Gospel of Mark, the Recognitions,
the Second Epistle of Peter, constitute the series
proceeding from the Ebionitish side; while from the Pauline
came the First Epistle of Peter, the Preaching of Peter, the
writings of Luke, the First Epistle of Clement, the Epistle
to the Philippians, the Pastoral Epistles, Polycarp's, and the
Ignatians. These productions, however, springing from the
practical instinct of the West, deal with the ecclesiastical more
than with the doctrinal phase of antagonism between the two
directions; and end with establishing in Rome a Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Church, founded on the united sepulchres of Peter and Paul,
and combining the sacerdotalism of the Old Testament with
the universality of the New Gentile Gospel. Meanwhile, a
similar course, with local modifications, was run by the Church
of Asia Minor. Rome, with its political aptitude, having
taken in hand the questions of discipline and organization, the
speculative genius of the Asiatic Greek addressed itself simultaneously
to the development and determination of doctrine.
Here the Epistle to the Galatians marks, as a starting-point,
the same original struggle between the contrasted elements
which the Epistle to the Romans betrays in Italy; while the
Gospel of John closes the dogmatic strife of development
with an accepted Trinity for faith, just as the Ignatian Epistles
wind up the contests of the West with a recognized hierarchy
for government. And between these extremes the East presents
to us, first, the intensely Judaical Apocalypse; next,
with increasing reaction in the Pauline direction, the rudiments
of the Logos idea in the Epistles to the Hebrews, Colossians,
and Ephesians; and as Montanism, in the midst of
which these arose, had already made familiar the conception
of the Paraclete, all the conditions were present for combination
into the Johannine doctrine of the Trinity; and then it
was, in the second quarter of the second century, that the
fourth Gospel appeared. The speculative theology thus
native to Lesser Asia was adopted for shelter and growth by
the kindred Hellenism of Egypt, and gave rise to the school
of Alexandria. In the whole of this theory great use is made
of Montanism: it spans, as it were, the interval between the
parallel movements of Italy and Asia; and is the common
medium of thought in which they both take place. Singularly
uniting in itself the rigor, the narrowness, the ascetic superstitions
of its Hebrew basis, with a Phrygian prophetic
enthusiasm and an Hellenic theosophy, it imported the latter
into the doctrine, the former into the discipline, of the Church.
The Roman Catholic system betrays its Jewish or Montanist
origin in its legalism, its penances, its celibacy, its monachism,
its ecstatic phenomena, its physical supernaturalism, its exaggerated
appreciation of martyrdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p><p>Such, in barest outline, is the theory which M. Bunsen
characterizes as the "Tübingen romance." Its leading principle
is, that the antagonism between the Petrine and Pauline,
the Hebrew and the Hellenic Gospel, which has its origin
and authentic expression in the Epistles to the Galatians, Romans,
and Corinthians, continued into the second century; determined
the evolution of doctrine and usage; stamped itself
upon the ecclesiastical literature; and ended in the compromise
and reconciliation of the Catholic Church. It is evident
that, in the working out of this principle, the New Testament
canon is made to give way. With the exception of the greater
Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse, both of which are
held fast as genuine productions of the Apostles whose names
they bear, and the first Gospel, which is allowed to have at
least the groundwork in the primitive tradition, the received
books are all set loose from the dates and names usually assigned
to them, and arranged, in common with other products
of the time, according to the relation they bear to the Ebionitish
or to the Pauline school, and the particular stage they seem
to mark in the history of either. This proceeding, however,
is not an original violence resorted to for the exigencies of the
theory; but, for the most part, a mere appropriation to its use
of conclusions reached by antecedent theologians on independent
grounds. The Epistle to the Philippians is the only
work, if we mistake not, on the authenticity of which doubt
has been thrown for the first time,&mdash;in our opinion, on very
inadequate grounds. In this, as in many other details of the
hypothetical history, there is not a little of that straining of
real evidence and subtle fabrication of unreal, which German
criticism seems unable to avoid. But the acerbity displayed
by the North German theologians towards the Tübingen critics
appears to us unwarranted and humiliating; and we certainly
wish that M. Bunsen, whose prompt admiration of
excellence so nobly distinguishes him from Ewald, could have
expressed his dissent from Baur and Schwegler in a tone still
further removed from the Göttingen pitch. At least, we do
not find the positive assertion that the Tübingen theory is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
finally demolished by the "Philosophumena" at all borne out
by the evidence; and are inclined to think that the case is
very little altered by the new elements now contributed to its
discussion. The critical offence which he thinks is now detected
and exposed, is the ascription of a late origin to the
fourth Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and the treatment of it as the perfected product,
instead of the misused source, of the Montanist conceptions
of the Logos and the Paraclete. It cannot, however, be
denied, that, in the previous absence of any external testimony
to the existence of this Gospel earlier than the year 170,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
the internal difficulties are sufficiently serious to redeem the
doubt of its authenticity from the character of rashness or
perversity. The irreconcilable opposition between its whole
mode of thought and that of the Apocalypse is confessed by
M. Bunsen himself, when he suggests that the proem on the
Logos was directed against Cerinthus,&mdash;the very person
whose sentiments the Apocalypse was supposed to express,
and to whom, accordingly, it was ascribed by those who rejected
it. <i>One</i> of the two books must resign, then, the name of
the beloved disciple; and, of the two, we need hardly say
that the Apocalypse is incomparably the better authenticated.
Moreover, the traditions which unite the names of James and
John, as the authorities followed by the Church of Lesser
Asia, render it hard to conceive that their doctrines can have
taken precisely opposite directions; and that, while James
represented the Judaic Christianity of the deepest dye, John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
can have produced the standard and conclusive work on the
other side. In particular, the well-known fact, that the Asiatic
Christians justified their Jewish mode of keeping Easter
by the double plea, (1.) that James and John always did so,
(2.) that Christ himself had done so before he suffered, seems
incompatible with any knowledge of the fourth Gospel, which
denies that Jesus ate the passover before he suffered, and
makes his own death to <i>be</i> the passover. How could this
Quartodeciman controversy live a day among a people possessing
and acknowledging John's Gospel, which so bears
upon it as to give a distinct contradiction to the view of the
other Gospels, and to pronounce in Asia Minor itself an unambiguous
verdict in favor of the West? These are grave difficulties,
which, after all the ingenuity, even of Bleek, remain,
we fear, unrelieved; and in their presence we cannot feel the
justice of M. Bunsen's sentence, that Baur's opinion is "the
most unhappy of philological conjectures." Everything conjectural,
however, must give way before real historical testimony;
and, if new evidence is actually contained in the "Philosophumena,"
every true critic, of Tübingen or elsewhere,
will be thankful for light to dissipate the doubt. Now, it is
said that our Roman bishop, in treating of the heresy of Basilides,
supplies passages from the writings of this heresiarch
which include quotations from the fourth Gospel; and thus
prove its existence as early as the year 130. This argument,
as stated by M. Bunsen, appeared to us quite conclusive, and
we hoped, that a decided step had been gained towards the settlement
of the question. Great was our disappointment, on
reading the account in the original, to find no evidence that
any extract from Basilides was before us at all. A general
description of the system bearing his name is given; but with
no mention of any work of his, no profession that the words
are his, and even so little individual reference to him, that
the exposition is introduced as being a report of what "Basilides
and Isidorus, and the whole troop of these people, falsely
say" (καταψευδεται, sing.). Then follows the account of the
dogmas of the sect, with the word φησιν inserted from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
time, to indicate that the writer is still reporting the sentiments
of others. The <i>singular</i> form of this word implies
nothing at all; it occurs immediately after the word καταψευδεται,
and has the same avowedly plural subject. The statement,
therefore, within which are contained the Scripture citations,
is a merely general one of the opinions of a sect which
continued to subsist till a much later time than the lowest date
ever assigned for the composition of the fourth Gospel. If the
actual words of any writings current among these heretics are
given, they are the words of an author or authors wholly unknown,
and to refer them to Basilides in particular is a mere
arbitrary act of will. The change from the singular to the
plural forms of citation in the midst of one and the same sentence,
and the disregard of concord between verb and subject,
show that no inference can be drawn from so loose a system of
grammatical usage. All that can be affirmed is, that our author
had in his hand <i>some</i> production of the Basilidian χορος,
in which the fourth Gospel was quoted; but this affords no
chronological datum that can be of the smallest use.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
same remark applies to the use of John's Gospel by the
Ophites. That they did use it is evident; that they existed as
far back as the time of Peter and Paul is certainly probable;
yet it does not follow that the fourth Gospel was then extant.
For they continued in existence through two or three centuries,
dating, as Baur has shown, from a time anterior not only to
the Christian heresies, but to Christianity itself, and extending
down to Origen's time; and to what part of this long period
the writings belonged which the author of the "Philosophumena"
employed, we are absolutely unable to determine. We
do not know why M. Bunsen has not appealed also to a quotation
from the Gospel which occurs (p. 194) in an account of
the Valentinian system. If, as he affirms (I. 63), this account
were really in "<i>Valentinus's own words</i>," the citation would
be of particular value in the controversy. For it has always
been urged by the Tübingen critics as a highly significant fact,
that while the <i>followers</i> of Valentinus showed an especial
eagerness to appeal to the Gospel of John, and one of the earliest,
Heracleon, wrote a commentary upon it, no trace could be
found of its use by the heresiarch himself. From this circumstance,
they have inferred that the Gospel was not available
for him, and first appeared after his time. A single
clause cited by him from the Gospel would demolish this argument
at once. But the assertion that we have here "full
eight pages of Valentinus's own words" appears to us quite
groundless. No such thing is affirmed by the writer of the
eight pages. He promises to tell us how the strict adherents
to the original principle of the sect expounded their doctrine
(ὡς εκεινοι διδασκουσι); and then passes over, as usual, to
the singular φησι, returning, however, from time to time, to
the plural forms,&mdash;θελουσι, λεγουσι, &amp;c.,&mdash;and thus leaving
no pretext for the assumption that Valentinus is before us in
person. The later Gnostics indisputably resorted to the Gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
of John with especial zeal and preference; and if their
predecessors, Basilides and Valentinus, were acquainted with
the book, it is surprising that no trace of their familiarity with
it has been found; and that the former should have sought to
authenticate the secret doctrine he professed to have received
by the name of Matthew or Matthias instead of John. It deserves
remark, that the citations preserved by our author are
made, like those of Justin Martyr, as from an anonymous writing,
without mentioning the name of the Evangelist; a circumstance
less surprising in reference to the Synoptics alone,
which present only varieties of the same fundamental tradition,
than when the fourth Gospel, so evidently the independent
production of a single mind, is thrown into the group. The
Epistles of Paul and the books of the Old Testament are frequently
quoted by name; and why this practice should invariably
cease whenever the historical work of an Apostle was
in the hand, it is not easy to explain. The Apocalypse is mentioned
not without his name.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>For these reasons we are of opinion that the question about
the date and authenticity of the fourth Gospel is wholly unaffected
by the newly-discovered work. On this side, no new
facilities are gained for confuting the Tübingen theory. The
most positive and startling fact against it is presented from
another direction. We know that the system of Theodotus,
which was Unitarian, was condemned by Victor in the last
decade of the second century.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Now Victor was the very
pope to the end of whose period, according to the followers of
Artemon, their monarchian faith was upheld in the Roman
Church, and in the time of whose successor was the first importation
of the higher doctrine of the Logos. On this complaint
of the Artemonites, Baur and Schwegler lay great stress;
but is it not refuted by Victor's orthodox act of expelling a
Unitarian? Undoubtedly it would be so, <i>if</i> Theodotus were
excommunicated precisely for his belief in the uni-personality
of God. But his scheme included many articles; and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
know nothing of the ground taken in the proceedings against
him. There was one question, however, which, however indifferent
to us, was evidently very near to the feelings of the
early Church, and on which Theodotus separated himself from
the prevailing conceptions of his time,&mdash;viz. At what date
did the Christ, the Divine principle, become united with Jesus,
the human being? "At his baptism," replied Theodotus.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
"Before his birth," said the general voice of the Christians.
We are disposed to think <i>this</i> was the obnoxious tenet
which Victor construed into heresy; and if so, the strife had
no bearing upon the doctrine of the personality of the Logos,
which the pope and the heretic might both have rejected. Of
the Unitarianism of that time, it was no essential feature to
postpone till the baptism the heavenly element in Christ.
We remember no reason for supposing that the Artemonites
did so, though Theodotus did; and if they knew that the objection
which had been fatal to him did not apply to them,
their claim of ancient and orthodox sanction for what they
held in common with him was not answered by pointing to
his condemnation for what was special to himself. But is
there, it will be asked, any evidence that the Roman Church
attached importance to this particular ingredient of the Theodotian
scheme, so that their bishop might feel impelled to
visit it with ecclesiastical censure? We believe there is, and
<i>that</i> too in the "Philosophumena." In the author's confession
of faith occurs a passage which produces at first a strange
impression upon a modern reader, and appears like a violence
done to the Gospel history. It affirms that Christ <i>passed
through every stage of human life</i>, that he might serve as the
model to all. Nor is this idea a personal whim of the writer;
but is borrowed from his master, Irenæus, who gives it in
more detail, and winds it up with the assertion, that Christ
<i>lived to be fifty years old</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Irenæus thus falsifies the history
to make good the moral; our presbyter, by respecting the
history, apparently invalidates the moral: for it can scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
be said of a life closed after thirty-one or thirty-two years,
that it supplies a rule πασα ἡλικιη; at least it would seem more
natural to apologize for its premature termination, than to lay
stress on its absolute completeness. The truth is, there was
a certain, obnoxious tenet behind, which these writers were
anxious to contradict, and which their assertion exactly meets,&mdash;viz.
the very tenet of Theodotus, that the Divine nature
did not unite itself with the Saviour till his baptism. Irenæus
and his pupil could not endure this limitation of what
was highest in Christ to the interval between his first public
preaching and his crucifixion. They thought that in this way
it was reduced to a mere official investiture, not integral to his
being, but externally superinduced; and that such a conception
deprived it of all its moral significance. The union of the
Logos with our nature was not a provision for temporary inspiration
or a forensic redemption; but was intended to mould
a life and shape a personal existence, according to the immaculate
ideal of humanity. To accomplish this intention it
was necessary that the Logos should never be absent from
any part of his earthly being; but should have claimed his
person from the first, and by preoccupation have neutralized
the action of the natural (or psychic) element, throughout all
the years of his continuance among men. The anxiety of
Irenæus's school to put this interpretation on the manifestation
of the Logos, their determination to distinguish it, on the one
hand, from the <i>mediate</i> communication of prophets as an <i>immediate</i>
presentation (αυτοψει φανερωθηναι), and, on the other,
from the <i>transient</i> occupancy of a ready-made man, as a <i>permanent</i>
and thorough-going incarnation (σαρκωθηναι in opposition
to φαντασια or τροπη), is apparent in their whole language
on this subject. In the Son, we are carried to the
fresh fountain-head of every kind of perfection, and find the
unspoiled ideal of heavenly and terrestrial natures. In one
of the fragments of Hippolytus, published by Mai, and noticed
in M. Bunsen's Appendix, this notion is conveyed by the remark,
that He is first-born of God's own essence, that he may
have precedence of angels; first-born of a virgin, that he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
be a fresh-created Adam; first-born of death, that he might
become the first fruits of our resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This doctrine it
is, we apprehend, which amplifies itself into the Irenæan statement,
that the divine and ideal function of Christ coalesced
with the historical throughout, so that to infants he was a consecrating
infant; to little children, a consecrating child; to
youth, a consecrating model of youth; and to elders, a still
consecrating rule, not only by disclosure of truth, but by exhibiting
the true type of their perfection.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The teaching of
Theodotus, that the heavenly εικων remained at a distance till
the baptism, was directly contradictory of this favorite notion;
and might well produce hostile excitement, and provoke condemnation,
in a church where the Irenæan influence is known
to have been powerful. The attitude that Victor assumed
towards the Theodotians is thus perfectly compatible with
Monarchian opinions, and with an attitude equally hostile,
in the opposite direction, towards the advancing Trinitarian
claims of a distinct personality for the Logos. Though only
the one hostility is recorded of Victor, the other is ascribed,
as we have seen, to his immediate successors, Zephyrinus and
Callistus, who maintained that it was no other person than
the Father that dwelt as the Logos in the Son. The facts
taken together, and spreading as they do over the periods of
three popes, afford undeniable traces of a struggle at the turn
of the second century, between a prevalent but threatened
Monarchianism, and a new doctrine of the Divine Personality
of the Son.</p>

<p>After all, why is M. Bunsen so anxious to disprove the
late appearance of the fourth Gospel? Did he value it chiefly
as a biographical sketch, and depend upon it for concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
facts, a first-hand authentication of its contents would be of
primary moment. But his interest in it is evidently speculative
rather than historical, and centres upon its doctrinal
thought, not on its narrative attestation; and especially singles
out the proem as a condensed and perfect expression of Christian
ontology. The book speaks to him, and finds him, out
of its mystic spiritual depths; sanctifies his own philosophy;
glorifies with an ideal haze the greatest reality of history;
blends with melting tints the tenderness of the human, and
the sublimity of the divine life; and presents the Holy Spirit
as immanent in the souls of the faithful and the destinies of
humanity. But its enunciation of great truths, its penetration
to the still sanctuary of devout consciousness, will not cease
to be facts, or become doubtful as merits, or be changed in
their endearing power, by an alteration in the superscription
or the date. These religious and philosophical features converse
directly with Reason and Conscience, and have the same
significance, whatever their critical history may be; and are
not the less rich as inspirations from having passed for interpretation
through more minds than one. There is neither
common sense nor piety, as M. Bunsen himself, we feel certain,
will allow, in the assumption that Revelation is necessarily
most perfect at its source, and can only grow earthy and
turbid as it flows. Were it something entirely foreign to the
mind, capable of holding no thought in solution, but inevitably
spoiled by every abrasion it effects of philosophy and
feeling, this mechanical view would be correct. But if it be
the intenser presence, the quickened perception of a Being
absent from none; if it be the infinite original of which philosophy
is the finite reflection; if thus it speaks, not in the
unknown tongue of isolated ecstasy, but in the expressive
music of our common consciousness and secret prayer;&mdash;then
is it so little unnatural, so related to the constitution of our
faculties, that the mind's continuous reaction on it may bring
it more clearly out; and, after being detained at first amid
sluggish levels and unwholesome growths which mar its divine
transparency, it may percolate through finer media, drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
its accidental admixtures, and take up in each stratum of
thought some elements given it by native affinity, and become
more purely the spring of life in its descent than in its source.
If, before the fourth Gospel was written, the figure of Christ,
less close to the eye, was seen more in its relations to humanity
and to God; if his deep hints, working in the experience
of more than one generation, had expanded their marvellous
contents; if, in a prolonged contact of his religion with Hellenism,
elements had disclosed themselves of irresistible sympathy,
and the first sharp boundary drawn by Jewish hands
had melted away; if his concrete history itself was now subordinate
to its ideal interpretation;&mdash;the book will present us
still with a Christianity, not impoverished, but enriched. In
proportion as its thoughts speak for themselves by their depth
and beauty, may all anxiety cease about their external legitimation;
their credentials become eternal instead of individual;
and where the Father himself thus beareth witness,
Christ needeth not the testimony of man. It cannot be, therefore,
any religious issue that depends on the date of this
Christian record; it cannot <i>make</i> truth, it can only awaken
the mind to discern it; and whether it has this power or not,
the mind can only report according to its consciousness of
quickening light or stagnant darkness. The interest of this
question cannot surely be more than a <i>critical</i> interest, to one
who can feel and speak in this noble strain:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No divine authority is given to any set of men to make
truth for mankind. The supreme judge is the Spirit in the
Church, that is to say, in the universal body of men professing
Christ. The universal conscience is God's highest interpreter.
If Christ speaks truth, his words must speak to the
human reason and conscience, whenever and wherever they
are preached: let them, therefore, be preached. If the Gospels
contained inspired wisdom, they must themselves inspire
with heavenly thoughts the conscientious inquirer and the
serious thinker: let them, therefore, freely be made the object
of inquiry and of thought. Scripture, to be believed true
with full conviction, must be at one with reason: let it, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
be treated rationally. By taking this course, we shall
not lose strength; but we shall gain a strength which no
church ever had. There is strength in Christian discipline, if
freely accepted by those who are to submit to it; there is
strength in spiritual authority, if freely acknowledged by those
who care for Christ; there is strength unto death in the enthusiasm
of an unenlightened people, if sincere, and connected
with lofty moral ideas. But there is no strength to be compared
with that of a faith which identifies moral and intellectual
conviction with religious belief, with that of an authority
instituted by such a faith, and of a Christian life based
upon it, and striving to Christianize this world of ours, for
which Christianity was proclaimed. Let those who are sincere,
but timid, look into their conscience, and ask themselves
whether their timidity proceeds from faith, or whether it does
not rather betray a want of faith. Europe is in a critical
state, politically, ecclesiastically, socially. Where is the power
able to reclaim a world, which, if it be faithless, is become so
under untenable and ineffective ordinances,&mdash;which, if it is in
a state of confusion, has become confused by those who have
spiritually guided it? Armies may subdue liberty; but armies
cannot conquer ideas: much less can Jesuits and Jesuitical
principles restore religion, or superstition revive faith. I
deny the prevalence of a destructive and irreligious spirit in
the hearts of the immense majority of the people. I believe
that the world wants, not less, but more religion. But however
this be, I am firmly convinced that God governs the
world, and that he governs it by the eternal ideas of truth
and justice engraved on our conscience and reason; and I
am sure that nations, who have conquered, or are conquering,
civil liberty for themselves, will sooner or later as certainly
demand liberty of religious thought, and that those whose
fathers have victoriously acquired religious liberty will not
fail to demand civil and political liberty also. With these
ideas, and with the present irresistible power of communicating
ideas, what can save us except religion, and therefore
Christianity? But then it must be a Christianity based upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
that which is eternally God's own, and is as indestructible
and as invincible as he is himself: it must be based upon
Reason and Conscience, I mean reason spontaneously embracing
the faith in Christ, and Christian faith feeling itself at
one with reason and with the history of the world. Civilized
Europe, as it is at present, will fall; or it will be pacified by
this liberty, this reason, this faith. To prove that the cause
of Protestantism in the nineteenth century is identical with
the cause of Christianity, it is only necessary to attend to this
fact; that they both must sink and fall, until they stand upon
their indestructible ground, which, in my inmost conviction, is
the real, genuine, original ground upon which Christ placed it.
Let us, then, give up all notions of finding any other basis, all
attempts to prop up faith by effete forms and outward things:
let us cease to combat reason, whenever it contradicts conventional
forms and formularies. We must take the ground
pointed out by the Gospel, as well as by the history of Christianity.
We may then hope to realize what Christ died for,
to see the Church fulfil the high destinies of Christianity, and
God's will manifested by Christ to mankind, so as to make
the kingdoms of this earth the kingdoms of the Most High."&mdash;p.

<p>We have given our readers no conception of the variety
and richness of M. Bunsen's work; having scarcely passed
beyond the limits of the first volume. It was impossible to
pass by, without examination, the recovered monument of
early Christianity, whence his materials and suggestions are
primarily drawn; and it is equally impossible to pass beyond
it, without entering on a field too wide to be surveyed. We
can only record that, in the remaining volumes, which are, in
fact, a series of separate productions, the early doctrine of the
Eucharist is investigated, and the progress of its corruptions
strikingly traced; the primitive system of ecclesiastical rules
or canons, and the "Church-and-House Book," or manual of
instruction and piety in use among the ante-Nicene Christians,
are carefully and laboriously restored; and genuine
Liturgies of the first centuries are reproduced. In this arduous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
work of recovery, there is necessarily much need of
critical tact, not to say much room for critical conjecture.
But the one our author exercises with great felicity; and the
other he takes all possible pains to reduce to its lowest amount
by careful comparison of Syrian, Coptic, and Abyssinian texts.
The general result is a truly interesting set of sketches for a
picture of the early Church; which rises before us with no
priestly pretensions, no scholastic creeds, no bibliolatry, dry
and dead; but certainly with an aspect of genuine piety and
affection, and with an air of mild authority over the whole of
life, which are the more winning from the frightful corruption
and dissolving civilization of the Old World around. That
our author should be fascinated with the image he has re-created,
and long to see it brought to life, in place of that
body of death on which we hang the pomps and titles of our
nominal Christianity, is not astonishing. But a greater change
is needed&mdash;though a far less will be denied&mdash;than a return
to the type of faith and worship in the second century. To
destroy the fatal chasm between profession and conviction,
and bring men to live fresh out of a real reverence instead
of against a pretended or a fancied one, a greater latitude and
flexibility must be given to the forms of spiritual culture than
was needed in the ancient world. The unity of system which
was once possible is unseasonable amid our growing varieties
of condition and culture; and the methods which were natural
among a people closely thrown together and constructing their
life around the Church as a centre, would be highly artificial
in a state of society in which the family is the real unit, and
the congregation a precarious aggregate, of existence. Nothing,
however, can be finer or more generous than the spirit of
our author's suggestions of reform; and we earnestly thank
him for a profusion of pregnant thoughts and faithful warnings,
the application of one half of which would change the
fate of our churches,&mdash;the destiny of our nation,&mdash;the
courses of the world.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>These two books are placed together without the least intention
to intimate a resemblance between them, or to represent
either author as sharing in the conclusions of the other.
They are, indeed, concerned with opposite sides of the same
subject; viewed, moreover, from the separate stations of the
layman and the divine; and are the expression of strongly
contrasted modes of thought. Mr. Greg deals principally
with the external vehicle of the primitive Christianity; Mr.
Thom with its internal essence. The one seeks in vain for
any outward title in the records to suppress the operations of
natural reason; the other clears away from the interior every
interference with the free action of conscience and affection.
The one, in the name of science, demolishes the outworks of
ecclesiastical logic with which the shrine of faith has been
dangerously guarded: the other, in the name of Christ, expels
both priest and dogma from the sanctuary itself. The
one, selecting deep truths from the words of Jesus, would
construct religion into a philosophy; the other, with eye upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
His person as an image of perfect goodness, would develop it
from a sentiment. As all opposites, however, are embraced
in the circumference of the same circle, so are these works
complements of each other. Mr. Greg, in common with the
Catholics and the Unitarians, evidently looks for the strength
of Christianity in the Gospels; Mr. Thom, with the majority
of Protestants, in the Epistles. For want of some mediating
harmony between the two, each perhaps requires some correction:
the historical picture of Christ saved by the former
is but a pale and meagre outline; while the Pauline ideal
presented by the latter is a glow of rich but undefined coloring.
Mr. Greg, who, in spite of particular errors, manifests
a large knowledge and a masterly judgment in his criticism of
the Evangelists, appears to have, in his own sympathies, no
way of access to a mind like that of Paul, and to be much at
fault in estimating the place of the Apostle both as a witness
and a power in the organization of Christian tradition and
doctrine. Had the acuteness and severity of his understanding
been a little more qualified by such reflective depth and
moral tenderness as Mr. Thom brings to the work of interpretation,
his religion, we fancy, would have retained a less
slender remnant of the primitive Christianity.</p>

<p>Measured by the standard of common Protestantism, there
can be no doubt that the second of these books would be
condemned for heresy, and the first for unbelief. These ugly
words, however, have been too often applied to what is fullest
of truth and faith, to express more than a departure, which
weak men feel to be irritating, from a favorite type of thought.
They have lost their effect on all who are competent to meditate
on the great problems of religion, and are fast taking
their place in the scandalous vocabulary of professional polemics.
It is a thing offensive to <i>just</i> men when divines, who
have succeeded in smothering, or been too dull to entertain,
doubts which rend the soul of genius and faithfulness, and
insist on a veracious answer, meet them, not with sympathy,
still less with mastery, but with the commonplaces of incompetent
pity and holy malediction. And the offence is doubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
in the eyes of <i>instructed</i> men, who know the state to which
Biblical criticism has brought the theology of the Reformation.
It is notorious that, in the revolt from Rome, the Scriptures&mdash;like
a dictator suddenly created for the perils of a crisis&mdash;were
forced into a position where it was impossible for them
permanently to repose; that they cannot be treated as infallible
oracles of either fact or doctrine, and were never meant to
bear the weight of such unnatural claims; that the authority
once concentrated in them, and held even <i>against</i> the reason
and conscience, must now be distributed, and ask their concurrence.
These are not questionable positions, but so irresistibly
established, that learning of the highest order would
no more listen to an argument against them, than Herschel or
Airy to a disquisition against the rotation of the earth. When
a clergyman, therefore, treats them with horror, and denounces
them as infidelity, he produces no conviction, except
that he himself is either ill-informed or insincere. Professional
reproaches against a book so manly and modest, so
evidently truth-loving, so high-minded and devout, as this of
Mr. Greg's, are but a melancholy imbecility. We may hold to
many things which he resigns; we may think him wrong in
the date of a Gospel or the construction of a miracle; we
may even dissent from his estimate of the grounds of immortal
hope and the ways of eternal Providence: but we do not
envy, and cannot understand, the religion which can feel no
thankful communion with thought so elevated, and trust so
sound and real. No candid reader of the "Creed of Christendom"
can close the book without the secret acknowledgment
that it is a model of honest investigation and clear
exposition; that it is conceived in the true spirit of serious
and faithful research; and that whatever the author wants of
being an ecclesiastical Christian is plainly not essential to the
noble guidance of life, and the devout earnestness of the
affections.</p>

<p>It is highly honorable to an English layman, amid the
pressure of affairs, to take up a class of critical inquiries,
which the clergy seem to have abandoned for a narrower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
more passionate polemic. It is a remarkable characteristic of
the present age, that, when the most startling attacks are made
upon the very foundations of existing churches, nobody repels
them. Nothing is offered to break their effect, except the
inertia of the mass that rests upon the base assailed. For
every great sceptical work of the last century there was some
score of reputable answers; but half a dozen books of the
same tendency have appeared within a few years, all of which
have been copiously reviewed, have spread excitement over a
wide surface, and set an immense amount of theological hair
on end, but not one of which has received any adequate reply.
Yet the slightest of these productions would favorably compare,
in all the requisites for successful persuasion,&mdash;in learning,
in temper, in acuteness,&mdash;with the best of the last age,
excepting only the philosophical disquisitions of Hume and
the ecclesiastical chapters of Gibbon. The first in time,&mdash;Hennell's
"Inquiry into the Origin of Christianity,"&mdash;though
the most open to refutation, was permitted to pass through an
unmolested existence; and its influence, considerable in itself,
and increased by the sweet and truthful character of the
author, is still traceable in the pages of Mr. Greg. To the
effect of Strauss's extraordinary work, the good Neander's
<i>Leben Jesu</i> offers but a mild resistance, and is itself, through
the extent of its concessions, an open proclamation that the
problems of theology can never be restored to the state in
which all churches assume them to be. Parker was excommunicated
by his sect; but his "Discourse of Matters pertaining
to Religion" has walked the course unchallenged, and
displayed the splendor of its gifts, within the entire lines of
the English language. Newman, Foxton, and Greg have
since entered their names on the <i>index expurgatorius</i> of
Orthodoxy; but they also will be simply excluded from the
sacred circle of readers bound over not to think; and, beyond
this, will make their converts undisturbed, and accumulate
fresh charges of threatening power in the intellectual atmosphere
which surrounds the Church. Whence this pusillanimous
apathy? Is it forgotten that creeds always assailed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
never defended are sure to perish? Or is it felt that the
defence, to be sound and strong, must be so partial&mdash;so limited
to points of detail&mdash;as to promise a mere diversion,
instead of a repulse, and be more dangerous than the attitude
of passiveness? Or does the Church resignedly give up her
hold on the class of earnest, intellectual men who cannot
degrade religion into a second-hand tradition, but must "know
what they worship"? Certain it is that her whole activity
has long abandoned this class, and addressed itself exclusively
to the narrower and lower order of mind, whose vision is
bounded by the periphery of a given creed, and whose life is
satisfied with the squabbles and the gossip of articles forced
into neighborhood, but no longer on speaking terms. If the
efficacy of "holy orders" is called in question, streams of
sacerdotal refutation flow from the press; but if the inspiration
of the twelve Apostles is denied, it is a thing that neither
bishop nor priest will care to vindicate. If a word of mistake
is uttered about the drops of water on the face of a
baptized baby, it conjures up a storm that rolls from diocese
to diocese; but if you say that pure religion has no rite or
sacrament at all, the ecclesiastic atmosphere remains still as a
Quaker's silent meeting. The deepest interest is felt about the
origin of liturgies, and the history of articles, but nobody heeds
the most staggering evidence that three of the Gospels are
second-hand aggregations of hearsay reports, and the fourth
of questionable authenticity. You deny the self-consistency
of the Church of England and call it a compromise; and the
sudden rustle of gowns and sleeves proclaims a great sensation.
You analyze the accounts of Christ's resurrection; you
ask whether they are not discrepant; you point out that,
apparently, the oldest record (Mark's) contained, in its original
form, no account of the event at all, and that the others
bear seeming traces of distinct and incompatible traditions.
You cry aloud for help in this perplexity, and hold yourselves
ready to follow any vestiges of truth; and, except that the
creeds are still muttered every Sunday, all the oracles are
dumb. If you want to find the true magic pass into heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
scores of rival professors press round you with obtrusive
supply: if you ask in your sorrow, Who can tell me whether
there be a heaven at all? every soul will keep aloof and leave
you alone. All men that bring from God a fresh, deep nature,
all in whom religious wants live with eager power, and
who yet are too clear of soul to unthink a thought and falsify
a truth, receive in these days no help and no response. The
Church feels its interest, as an <i>educated</i> corporation, to consist
in overlaying and covering up the foundations of faith with
huge piles of curious learning, history, and art, which, by
affording endless occupation, may detain men from search
after the living rock, or notice of the undermining flood.
And, as an <i>established</i> corporation, she relies on the lazy conservatism
of mental possession; on the dislike felt by the
comfortable classes towards the trouble of thought and the
disturbance of feeling, and their usual willingness to hand
over these operations to the prayer-book and the priest. We
are grateful to Mr. Greg for shaking this ignoble and precarious
reliance, which he notices in these admirable sentences.</p>

<p>"A more genuine and important objection to the consequences
of our views is felt by indolent minds on their own
account. They shrink from the toil of working out truth for
themselves out of the materials which Providence has placed
before them. They long for the precious metal, but loathe
the rude ore out of which it has to be extricated by the
laborious alchemy of thought. A ready-made creed is the
paradise of their lazy dreams. A string of authoritative,
dogmatic propositions comprises the whole mental wealth
which they desire. The volume of nature&mdash;the volume of
history&mdash;the volume of life&mdash;appall and terrify them. Such
men are the materials out of whom good catholics of all sects
are made. They form the uninquiring and submissive flocks
which rejoice the hearts of all priesthoods. Let such cling to
the faith of their forefathers, if they can. But men whose
minds are cast in a nobler mould, and are instinct with a
diviner life,&mdash;who love truth more than rest, and the peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Heaven rather than the peace of Eden,&mdash;to whom 'a loftier
being brings severer cares,'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Who know man does not live by joy alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">But by the presence of the power of God,'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>such must cast behind them the hope of any repose or tranquillity,
save that which is the last reward of long agonies of
thought; they must relinquish all prospect of any heaven,
save that of which tribulation is the avenue and portal; they
must gird up their loins and trim their lamp for a work which
cannot be put by, and which must not be negligently done.
'He,' says Zschokke, 'who does not like living in the <i>furnished
lodgings of tradition</i>, must build his own house, his
own system of thought and faith for himself.'"&mdash;p. 242.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Greg derives its interest, not from anything
in it that will be new to the studious theologian, but
from the freshness and force with which it presents the results
of the author's reading and reflection on both the claims and
the contents of Scripture. Adopting the ordinary notion of
"inspiration," as equivalent to a supernaturally provided
"infallibility," he reviews and condemns the reasonings by
which this attribute has been associated with the Bible; and
decides that the mere discovery of a statement in the Scriptures
is no sufficient reason for our implicit reception of it.
Having cleared away this obstacle to all intelligent criticism,
he pursues his way, chiefly under the guidance of De Wette,
through the earlier literature of the Hebrews; and adds
another to the many exposures of the humiliating attempts,
on the part of English divines, to reconcile the cosmogony of
Genesis with modern science; attempts which we should call
obsolete, did we not remember that Buckland and Whewell
are both living, and have not yet attained the episcopal bench.
Mr. Greg adopts the views of which Baur is the best known
recent expositor, but which Lessing long ago traced out, as to
the gradual formation of the Hebrew monotheism; and shows
the striking contrast between the family Jehovah of the Patriarchs
and the universal God of the later Prophets. Whatever
be the origin of the doctrine of a Messiah, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
whatever varieties it appeared, it never pointed, the author
conceives, to such a person as Jesus of Nazareth, or such a
product as the Christian Church; and it is only by perverse
interpretations, unendurable out of the field of theology, that
any passages in the Old Testament can be made out to prefigure
the events in the New. In the argument, therefore,
between the early missionaries of the Gospel and the unconvinced
Jews, Mr. Greg maintains that the latter were the
more faithful to their sacred books. The phenomena of the
first three Gospels are next examined sufficiently to explain
the several hypotheses respecting the order and materials of
their composition. The author rests on Schleiermacher's conclusion,
that a number of fragmentary records of incident and
discourse formed the groundwork, partly common, partly exclusive,
of the triple Evangile. He thus removes us, in this
portion of the Scriptures, from first-hand testimony altogether;
and throws upon internal criticism the task of discriminating
between the original and reliable elements on the one hand,
and those on the other which did not escape the accidents of
floating tradition and the coloring of later ideas. This delicate
task the author attempts; and manifests throughout an
acquaintance with the methods and models of the higher
criticism, fully qualifying him to form the independent judgment
which he sums up in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In conclusion, then, it appears certain that in all the
synoptical Gospels we have events related that did not really
occur, and words ascribed to Jesus which Jesus did not utter;
and that many of these words and events are of great significance.
In the great majority of these instances, however,
this incorrectness does not imply any want of honesty on the
part of the Evangelists, but merely indicates that they adopted
and embodied, without much scrutiny or critical acumen,
whatever probable and honorable narratives they found current
in the Christian community."&mdash;p. 137.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the fourth Gospel are next dealt with:
its apparent polemic reference to the gnosis of the first and
second centuries; its absence of demoniacs and parables; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
length, the mysticism, the dogma of its discourses, and their
uniformity of complexion with the historian's own narrative
and reflections; the narrowness of its charity, and the apocryphal
appearance of its "first miracle." Without questioning
the probability that within the contents of this Gospel is
secreted a nucleus of facts, Mr. Greg thinks the book so
clearly imbued throughout with the writer's idiosyncrasy, as
to be inferior in historical value to the Synoptics; and the
discourses of Jesus, in particular, must be regarded as free
compositions by the Evangelist. In our author's management
of this subject there seems to us to be an unfavorable change.
The style of thought peculiar to John, as well as that characteristic
of Paul, lies out of the latitude native to him; and
with every intention to be just in his appreciation, he fails, we
think, to reach the point of sympathy from which the fourth
Gospel should be judged. The realism of his mind makes
him a better critic of the hard Judaical element of the Christian
Scriptures, with its objective distinctness and its moral
beauty, than of the more ideal Gentile ingredients, where a
subjective dialectic traces forms of thought in the intense fires
of spiritual consciousness.</p>

<p>In a separate discussion of the question of miracles they
are restored to the subordinate position, as compared with
moral evidence, assigned to them by the early Protestant
divines. Adopting the position of Locke, that "the miracles
are to be judged by the doctrines, and not the doctrines by
the miracles," he can admit with the less pain his conviction,
that, even in the instance of the resurrection of Jesus, the
historical evidence is too conflicting and uncertain to bear the
supernatural weight imposed upon it. He admits, indeed,
that Jesus <i>may</i> have risen from the dead; the Apostles manifestly
believed it; and that the marked change in their character
and conduct, from despair to triumph, affords the strongest
evidence of the sustaining energy of this belief. But, in
our ignorance of the grounds of this belief, (the Gospels and
book of Acts containing no correct or first-hand report of the
facts,) it is impossible, he conceives, to form any rational estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of their adequacy. In Mr. Greg's decision on this
important point, we see the effect of his entrance on the
problem of Christianity from the historical end. If, instead
of addressing himself first to the Gospels which lie most remote
from the source of the religion, and represent the latest
and most constituted form of the primitive tradition, he had
begun with the earliest remains of Christian literature, and
traced the doctrine of the resurrection from the Epistles of
Paul into the story of the Evangelists, we think he would
have arrived at a different conclusion. In dismissing the
testimony of Paul as "of little weight," he throws away the
main evidence of the whole case. We can understand the
critic who, having put the miraculous entirely aside, as logically
inadmissible, makes light of the Pauline statements on
this matter, and appeals to their writer's openness to impressions
of the supernatural in proof of a certain vitiating unsoundness
of mind. But one who, like our author, regards
this <i>à priori</i> incredulity as an unphilosophical prejudice, and
upon whose list of real causes, never precluded from possible
action, supernatural power finds a place, cannot consistently
condemn another for believing in concrete instances what he
himself allows in the general; and put the Apostle out of
court, on the plea that we have no evidence but <i>his assertion</i>
of his intercourse with the risen Christ. Is not <i>his assertion</i>
the only evidence possible of a subjective miracle? and is
there any ground for restricting supernatural agency to an
objective direction? No doubt, facts presented to external
perception have the advantage of being open to more witnesses
than one; and if it be deliberately laid down as a
canon, that in no case can any anomalous event be admitted
on one man's declaration, we allow the consistency of refusing
a hearing to the Apostle. But such a rule would only be an
example of the futility of all attempts to reduce moral evidence
to mathematical expression. Facts of the most extraordinary
nature have always been, and will always be,
received on solitary attestation; and if so, it makes no logical
difference whether they be called "objective," or "subjective."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
A man has faculties for apprehending what passes within him,
as well as what passes without; nor do we know any ground
for trusting the latter which does not hold equally good for
the former. If it be said that the reporter of a miracle not
only announces what he sees or feels,&mdash;which we may accept
on his veracity,&mdash;but proclaims its supernatural source,&mdash;which
we may repudiate from distrust of his judgment,&mdash;the
remark is perfectly just, only that it applies alike to <i>all</i> testimony,
and not exclusively to miraculous reports. Our disposition
to receive the evidence of a witness assumed to be
veracious, depends on our having the same preconceptions of
causation with himself. In the ordinary affairs of life, this
common ground is sure to exist, and therefore remains a mere
latent condition of belief. But the slowness to admit a miracle
arises from the failure of this common ground; and if the
hearer reserved in the background of his mind, and in equal
readiness for action, the same supernatural power to which
the witness's assertion refers, he would feel no more temptation
to incredulity than in listening to some matter of course.
The reluctance to believe, is proof that his store of causation
is limited to the natural sphere; and every phenomenon irreducible
to this drops away from all hold upon his mind. As
there is no such thing as a fact perceived without a judgment
formed, so is there no belief in the attestation of a fact without
reliance on the soundness of a judgment; and that reliance
depends on the hearer having the same list of causes
in his mind as the witness. If, then, Mr. Greg holds, with
Paul, that the power exists whence a subjective miracle might
issue, and if from the nature of the case such miracle must
remain a matter of personal consciousness, why reject the
Apostle's report of his experience? In choosing from among
the causes which both parties admit, it cannot be denied that
Paul alights upon that which, <i>if there</i>, gives the easiest and
most certain explanation; and to find a satisfactory origin for
his impressions and conduct in natural agencies is so difficult,
that critics would never attempt it, but to escape the acknowledgment
of miracle. On his own principles we do not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
how our author could excuse himself to the Apostle for rejecting
his testimony; which does but communicate, in the only
conceivable way, that which is allowed to be possible enough,
and which best clears up the mystery of an astonishing revolution
in personal character, and in the convictions of an earnest
and powerful mind.</p>

<p>The whole question of miracles, however, loses its anxious
importance with those who, like our author, would still, amid
their constant occurrence, look to other sources for the credentials
of moral and religious truth. If anything is positively
and incontrovertibly known respecting the Apostles,&mdash;and in
proportion as we trust the synoptical Gospels must we allow
Mr. Greg to extend the remark to their Master,&mdash;it is this:
that whatever powers they exercised, and whatever communications
they received, were inadequate to preserve them
from serious error; and from delivering to the world, as a
substantive part of their message, a most solemn expectation
which was not to be fulfilled. This fact, no longer denied by
any reputable theologian, alone shows that, even in the presence
of the highest Christian authority, the natural criteria of
reason and conscience cannot be dispensed with. In the application
of these to the teachings and life of Christ, our
author finds, if not any truths of supernatural dictation, at
least the highest object of veneration and affection yet given
to this world.</p>

<p>"Now on this subject," he says, "we hope our confession of
faith will be acceptable to all save the narrowly orthodox. It
is difficult, without exhausting superlatives, even to unexpressive
and wearisome satiety, to do justice to our intense love,
reverence, and admiration for the character and teachings of
Jesus. We regard him, not as the perfection of the intellectual
or philosophic mind, but as the perfection of the spiritual
character,&mdash;as surpassing all men of all times in the closeness
and depth of his communion with the Father. In reading
his sayings, we feel that we are holding converse with the
wisest, purest, noblest Being that ever clothed thought in the
poor language of humanity. In studying his life, we feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
that we are following the footsteps of the highest ideal yet
presented to us upon earth. 'Blessed be God that so much
manliness has been lived out, and stands there yet, a lasting
monument to mark how high the tides of divine life have risen
in the world of man!'"&mdash;p. 227.</p>

<p>We differ altogether from our author in his notion of inspiration,
and his reduction of Christianity within the limits of
human resource. But we must say, that while there is such
an estimate as this of what Jesus Christ <i>was</i>, it is a matter of
subordinate moment what is thought about the mode in which
he <i>became so</i>.</p>

<p>By a process of "Christian Eclecticism," Mr. Greg draws
forth from the Gospels the elements which he regards as
characteristic of the religion of Jesus; distinguishing those
which make it the purest of faiths from others which appear
to him irreconcilable with a just philosophy. The doctrine
of a future life is reserved for a separate discussion; the general
result of which we know not how to describe, otherwise
than by saying that the author discards all the evidence and
yet retains the conclusion. All the arguments, metaphysical
and moral, for human immortality, he condemns as absolutely
worthless; he confesses that he has no new ones to propose;
he affirms that all appearances, without exception, proclaim
the permanence of death, the absence of any spiritual essence
in man, and the absolute sway of the laws of organization;
yet, on the report of that very "soul" within him, whose existence
nature disowns, he holds the doctrine of a future existence
by the irresistible tenure of a first truth. We do not
wonder that the rigor with which Mr. Greg has pushed his
principles through other subjects of thought should relent at
this point, and refuse to cast the sublimest of human hopes
over the brink of darkness. We respect, as a holy abstinence,
his refusal to silence the pleadings of the inner voice. But
we admire his faith more than his philosophy; and are astonished
that he does not suspect the soundness of a scientific
method which lands him in results he cannot hold. No scepticism
is so fatal,&mdash;for none has so wide a sweep,&mdash;as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
which despairs of the self-reconciliation of human nature;
which flings among our faculties the reproach of irretrievable
contradiction; which sets up first truths against deductions,
conscience against science, faith against logic. Ever since
Kant balanced his Antinomies, and employed the gravitation
of <i>Practical</i> reason to turn the irresolute scales of the <i>Speculative</i>,
this unwholesome practice has been spreading, of assuming
an ultimate discordance between co-existing powers of
the mind. In the language of rhetoric or poetry, in the discussion
of popular notions on morals and religion, it would be
hypercritical to complain of the antitheses of understanding
and feeling,&mdash;sense and soul. But to an exact thinker it
must be apparent that an ambidextrous intellect is no intellect
at all; and that, were this all our endowment, the life of
the wisest would be but a chase after mocking shadows of
thought. The following words of our author, with all their
tranquil appearance, describe a state of things which, were it
real, might well strike us with dismay:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are three points especially of religious belief, regarding
which intuition (or instinct) and logic are at variance,&mdash;the
efficacy of prayer, man's free-will, and a future existence.
If believed, they must be believed, the last without
the countenance, the two former in spite of the hostility of
logic."&mdash;p. 303.</p>

<p>This is absolute Pyrrhonism, and though said in the interest
of religion, is subversive alike of knowledge and of faith.
The pretended "logic" can be good for very little, which
comes out with so suicidal an achievement as the <i>disproof of
first truths</i>. The condition under which alone logic can exist
as a science is the unity in the human mind of the laws of
belief,&mdash;a condition which would be violated if any first
truth contradicted another in itself, or in its deductions. The
moment, therefore, such a contradiction turns up, a consistent
thinker will either regard it as a mere semblance, and proceed
to re-examine his premises, and test his reasoning; or he will
treat it as real; and then it throws contempt on logic altogether,
and relegates it into impossibility. In neither case can his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
reliance incline to the logical side. Mr. Greg, however, sticks
to his logic whenever, as in the two cases mentioned in the
foregoing extract, it loudly <i>negatives</i> a point of religious belief;
and abandons it only where it restricts itself to cold and dumb
discouragement. A bolder distrust of <i>his</i> logic, and a firmer
faith in the logic of nature, would perhaps have harmonized
the differing voices of the intellect and the soul, blending them
in a faith neither afraid to think nor ashamed to pray.</p>

<p>Had our author been as familiar with the Catholic and Arminian
divines, as with the literature of inductive science and
Calvinistic theology, he would have known that there is a philosophy
from which the religious intuitions encounter no repugnance;
and would, at least, have noticed its offer of mediation
between Faith and Reason. He is, however, entirely
shut up within the formulas of a different school, which press
with their resistance on his religious feeling in every direction,
and produce a conflict which he can neither appease nor terminate.
With an intellect entirely overridden by the ideas of
Law and Necessity, no man can escape the force of the common
objections to any doctrine of prayer, or of forgiveness of
sin; and if those ideas possess universal validity, the very
discussion of such doctrines is, in the last degree, idle and
absurd. But what if some mediæval schoolman, or some impugner
of the Baconian orthodoxy, were to suggest that,
though Law is coextensive with outward nature, Nature is
not coextensive with God, and that beyond the range where
his agency is bound by the pledge of predetermined rules lies
an infinite margin, where his spirit is free? And what if, in
aggravation of his heresy, he were to contend that Man also,
as counterpart of God, belongs not wholly to the realm of
nature, but transcends it by a certain endowment of free
power in his spirit? Having made these assumptions, on the
ground that they were more agreeable to "intuitive" feeling,
and not less so to external evidence, than the one-sidedness
of their opposites, might he not suggest that room is now
found for a doctrine of prayer? Not that any event bespoken
and planted in the sphere of nature can be turned aside by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the urgency of desire and devotion; not that the slightest
swerving is to be expected from the usages of creation, or of
the mind; wherever law is established&mdash;without us or within
us&mdash;there let it be absolute as the everlasting faithfulness.
But God has not spent himself wholly in the courses of custom,
and mortgaged his infinite resources to nature; nor has
he closed up with rules every avenue through which his fresh
energy might find entrance into life; but has left in the human
soul a theatre whose scenery is not all pre-arranged, and
whose drama is ever open to new developments. Between
the free centre of the soul in man, and the free margin of the
activity of God, what hinders the existence of a real and
living communion, the interchange of look and answer, of
thought and counterthought? If, in response to human aspiration,
a higher mood is infused into the mind; if, in consolation
of penitence or sorrow, a gleam of gentle hope steals in;
and if these should be themselves the vivifying touch of divine
sympathy and pity, what law is prejudiced? what faith
is broken? what province of nature has any title to complain?
And so, too, (might our mediæval friend continue,) with respect
to the doctrine of forgiveness. If men are under moral
obligation, and God is a being of moral perfection, he must
regard their unfaithfulness with disapproval. Of his sentiments,
the clear trace will be found in the various sufferings
which constitute the natural punishment of wrong. These
are incorporated in the very structure of the world and the
constitution of life; and to persistence in their infliction, the
Supreme Ruler is committed by the assurance of his constancy.
They fasten on the guilty a chain which no pardon will
strike off, but which he will drag till it is worn away. <i>Not
all</i> the divine sentiment, however, is embodied in the physical
consequences. Besides this determinate expression of his
thought, written out on the finite world, there is an unexpressed
element remaining behind, in his infinite nature: on
the visible side of the veil is the suggestive manifestation; on
the invisible, is the very affection manifested. There is a
personal alienation, a forfeiture of approach and sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
which would survive though creation were to perish and carry
its punishments away; and would still cast its black shadow
into empty space. This reserved sentiment, and this alone, is
affected by repentance. But it is no small thing for the heart
of shame to know this. The estrangement lasts no longer
than the guilty temper and the unsoftened conscience; and
when, through its sorrow, the mind is clear and pure, the
sunshine of divine affection will burst it again. In this the
free Spirit of God is different from his bound action in nature.
Long after he himself has forgiven and embraced again, necessity&mdash;the
creature of his legislation&mdash;will continue to
wield the lash, and measure out with no relenting the remainder
of the penalty incurred; and he that yet drags his burden
and visibly limps upon his sin, may all the while have a heart
at rest with God. And thus is retribution&mdash;the reaping as
we have sown&mdash;in no contradiction with forgiveness,&mdash;the
personal restoration.</p>

<p>How far such modes of thought as these would help to reconcile
the conflicting claims,&mdash;and how they would stand related
to Mr. Greg's terrible friend, "Logic," we do not pretend
to decide. We refer to them only as possible means of
escaping&mdash;at least of postponing&mdash;his desolating doctrine,
that intuitions may tell lies; and in support of our statement,
that his theoretic view lies entirely within the circle of
a particular school,&mdash;a school, moreover, so little able to satisfy
his aspirations, that he is obliged to patch up a compromise
between his nature and his culture. The curious amalgamation
which has taken place in England, of the metaphysics of
Calvin with the physics of Bacon, has produced, in a large
class, a philosophical tendency, with which the distinctive sentiments
of Christianity very uneasily combine. The effacing
of all lines separating the natural and moral, the limitation
of God to the realm of nature, and the subjugation of all
things to predestination, are among the chief features of this
tendency, and the chief obstacles to any concurrence between
the intellectual and the spiritual religion of the age.</p>

<p>If some of the elements in the early Christianity are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
hastily cancelled by our author, there is one sentiment whose
inapplicability to the present day he exposes with an irresistible
force;&mdash;that depreciating estimate of life which, however
natural to Apostles "impressed with the conviction that the
world was falling to pieces," is wholly misplaced among those
for whose office and work this earthly scene is the appointed
place. The exhortations of the Apostles, "granting the premises,
were natural and wise."</p>

<p>"But for divines in this day&mdash;when the profession of
Christianity is attended with no peril, when its practice, even,
demands no sacrifice, save that preference of duty to enjoyment
which is the first law of cultivated humanity&mdash;to repeat
the language, profess the feelings, inculcate the notions,
of men who lived in daily dread of such awful martyrdom,
and under the excitement of such a mighty misconception; to
cry down the world, with its profound beauty, its thrilling interests,
its glorious works, its noble and holy affections; to exhort
their hearers, Sunday after Sunday, to detach their heart
from the earthly life, as inane, fleeting, and unworthy, and fix
it upon heaven, as the only sphere deserving the love of the
loving or the meditation of the wise,&mdash;appears to us, we
confess, frightful insincerity, the enactment of a wicked and
gigantic lie. The exhortation is delivered and listened to as a
thing of course; and an hour afterwards the preacher, who
has thus usurped and profaned the language of an Apostle
who wrote with the fagot and the cross full in view, is sitting
comfortably with his hearer over his claret; they are fondling
their children, discussing public affairs or private plans in
life, with passionate interest, and yet can look at each other
without a smile or a blush for the sad and meaningless farce
they have been acting!... Everything tends to prove
that this life is, not perhaps, not probably, our only sphere,
but still an <i>integral</i> one, and <i>the</i> one with which we are
here meant to be concerned. The present is our scene of
action,&mdash;the future is for speculation and for trust. We
firmly believe that man was sent upon the earth to live in it,
to enjoy it, to study it, to love it, to embellish it,&mdash;to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the most of it, in short. It is his country, on which he should
lavish his affections and his efforts. <i>Spartam nactus es&mdash;hanc
exorna</i>. It should be to him a house, not a tent,&mdash;a
home, not only a school. If, when this house and this home
are taken from him, Providence, in its wisdom and its bounty,
provides him with another, let him be deeply grateful for the
gift,&mdash;let him transfer to that future, <i>when it has become his
present</i>, his exertions, his researches, and his love. But let
him rest assured that he is sent into this world, not to be constantly
hankering after, dreaming of, preparing for, another,
which may or may not be in store for him, but to do his
duty and fulfil his destiny on earth,&mdash;to do all that lies in his
power to improve it, to render it a scene of elevated happiness
to himself, to those around him, to those who are to come
after him. So will he avoid those tormenting contests with
nature,&mdash;those struggles to suppress affections which God
has implanted, sanctioned, and endowed with irresistible supremacy,&mdash;those
agonies of remorse when he finds that God
is too strong for him,&mdash;which now embitter the lives of so
many earnest and sincere souls; so will he best prepare for
that future which we hope for, if it come; so will he best
have occupied the present, if the present be his all. To demand
that we love heaven more than earth, that the unseen
should hold a higher place in our affections than the seen and
familiar, is to ask that which cannot be obtained without subduing
nature, and inducing a morbid condition of the soul.
The very law of our being is love of life, and all its interests
and adornments."&mdash;pp. 271, 272.</p>

<p>With all that is admirable in our author's book, he contemplates
the whole subject from a point of view which exhibits
it in very imperfect lights. He professes to treat of "The
Creed of Christendom." Yet, in examining only the canonical
Scriptures and the primitive belief, he totally ignores the
"Creed" of the greater part of "Christendom," namely, of the
Catholic Church. For it is only Protestants that identify
Christianity with the letter of the New Testament, and settle
everything by appeal to its contents. According to the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
doctrine, Christianity is not a Divine Philosophy recorded in
certain books, but a Divine Institution committed to certain
men. The Christian Scriptures are not its <i>source</i>, but its
first <i>product</i>; not its charter and definition, but its earliest act
and the expression of its incipient thought. They exhibit the
young attempts of the new agency, as it was getting to work
upon the minds of men and trying to penetrate the resisting
mass of terrestrial affairs. They are thus but the beginning
of a record which is prolonged through all subsequent times,
the opening page in the proceedings of a Church in perpetuity;
and are not separated from the continuous sacred literature
of Christendom, as insulated fragments of Divine authority.
The supernatural element which they contain did not die
out with their generation, but has never ceased to flow through
succeeding centuries. Nor did the heavenly purpose&mdash;precipitated
upon earthly materials and media&mdash;disclose itself most
conspicuously at first; but rather cleared itself as it advanced
and enriched its energy with better instruments. The sublimest
things would even lie secreted in the unconscious heart
of the new influence, and only with the slowness of noble
growths push towards the light; for the noise and obtrusiveness
of the human is ever apt to overwhelm the retiring silence
of the divine. The disciples, who, when events were
before their eyes, and great words fell upon their ears, "understood
not these things at the time," are types of all men
and all ages; whose religion, coming out in the event, is
known to others better than to themselves. A faith, therefore,
should be judged less by its first form than by its last;
and at all events be studied, not as it <i>once</i> appeared, but in
the entire retrospect of its existence.</p>

<p>No doubt this doctrine of development is made subservient,
in the Romish system, to monstrous sacerdotal claims. A
priestly hierarchy pretends to the exclusive custody, and the
gradual unfolding, of God's sacred gift. But sweep away this
holy corporation; throw its treasury open, and let its vested
right, of paying out the truth, be flung into the free air of
history; gather together no Sacred College but the collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
ages; appeal to no high Pontiff but the Providence of God;&mdash;and
there remains a far juster and sublimer view of the place
and function of a pure Gospel in the world, than the narrow
Protestant conception. Christianity becomes thus, not the
Creed of its Founders, but the Religion of Christendom, to
be estimated only in comparison with the faiths of other
groups of the great human family; and the superhuman in it
will consist in this,&mdash;the providential introduction among the
affairs of this world of a divine influence, which shall gradually
reach to untried depths in the hearts of men, and become
the organizing centre of a new moral and spiritual life. It is
a power appointed&mdash;an inspiration given&mdash;to fetch by reverence
a true religion out of man, and not, by dictation, to put
one into him.</p>

<p>For this end, it would not even be necessary that the bearers
of the divine element should be personally initiated into
the counsels whose ministers they are. <i>Philosophy</i> must
know what it teaches; but <i>Inspiration</i>, in giving the intensest
light to others, may have a dark side turned towards itself.
There is no irreverence in saying this, and no novelty: on the
contrary, the idea has ever been familiar to the most fervent
men and ages, of Prophets who prepared a future veiled from
their own eyes, and saintly servants of heaven, who drew to
themselves a trust, and wielded a power, which their ever-upward
look never permitted them to guess. Nay, to no one
was this conception less strange, than to the very man who,
in his turn, must now have it applied to himself. With the
Apostle Paul it was a favorite notion, that the entire plan of
the Divine government had been a profound secret during the
ages of its progress, and was opening into clear view only at
the hour of its catastrophe. Not only was there <i>more in it</i>
than had been surmised, but something utterly <i>at variance</i>
with all expectation. Its whole conception had remained unsuspected
from first to last; undiscerned by the vision of
seers, and unapproached by the guesses of the wise. Never
absent from the mind of God, and never pausing in its course
of execution, it had yet evaded the notice of all observers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
and winding its way through the throng of nations and the
labyrinth of centuries, the great Thought had passed in disguise,
using all men and known of none. Nor was it only
the pagan eye that, for want of special revelation, had been
detained in darkness, or beguiled with the scenery of dreams.
The very people whose life was the main channel of the
Divine purpose did not feel the tide of tendency which they
conveyed; the patriarchs who fed their flocks near its fountains,
the lawgiver who founded a state upon its banks, the
priests whose temple poured blood into its waters, and the
prophets at whose prayer the clouds of heaven dropped fresh
purity into the stream,&mdash;all were unconscious of its course;
assigning it to regions it should never visit, and missing the
point where it should be lost in the sea. Nay, Paul seems to
bring down this edge of darkness to a later time; to include
within it even the ministry of Christ and the Galilean Apostles;
to imply that even they were unconscious instruments
of a scheme beyond the range of their immediate thought;
and that not till Jesus had passed into the light of heaven
did the time come for revealing, through the man of Tarsus,
the significance of Messiah's earthly visit, and its place in the
great scheme of things. Paul, in claiming this as his own
special function, certainly implies that, previous to his call, no
one was in condition to interpret the secret counsels of God
in the historic development of his providence. He feels this
to be no reflection on his predecessors, no cause of elevation
in himself; steward as he is of a mighty mystery, he is less
than the least of all saints. He simply stands at the crisis
when a conception is permitted to the world, which even "the
angels have vainly desired to look into"; and though he may
<i>see</i> more, he <i>is</i> infinitely less than the Prophets and the Messiah
whose place it is given him to explain. He is but the
interpreter, they are the grand agencies interpreted. He is
but the discerning eye, they are the glorious objects on which
it is fixed.</p>

<p>In seeking, therefore, for the <i>divine element</i> in older dispensations,
the Apostle would assuredly <i>not</i> consult the projects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and beliefs of their founders and ministers. In his view,
the very scheme of God was to work through these without
their knowing what they were about; to let them aim at one
thing while he was directing them to another; to pour through
their life and soul an energy which should indeed fire their
will and flow from their lips in <i>their own</i> best purposes, but
steal quietly behind them for <i>his</i>; so that what was primary
with them was perhaps evanescent with him; while that
which was incidental, and dropped from them unawares, was
the seed of an eternal good. What Moses planned, what
David sung, what Isaiah led the people to expect, was not
what Heaven had at heart to execute. Even in quest of
God's thought in the <i>Christian</i> dispensation, Paul does not
refer to the doctrines, the precepts, the miracles of Jesus
during his ministry in Palestine,&mdash;to the memorials of his life,
or the testimony of his companions. He assumes that, at so
early a date, the time had not yet come for the truth to
appear, and that it was vain to look for it in the preconceptions
of the uncrucified and unexalted Christ; who was the
religion, not in revelation, but in disguise. If, therefore, any
one had argued against the Apostle thus: "Why tell us to
discard the law? your Master said he came to fulfil it. How
do you venture to preach to the Gentiles, when Jesus declared
his mission limited to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel? No vestiges of your doctrine of free grace can be
found in the parables, or of redeeming faith in the Sermon on
the Mount";&mdash;he would have boldly replied, that this proves
nothing against truths that are newer than the life, because
expounded by the death, of Christ; that God reveals by
action, not by teaching; that no servant of his can understand
his own office till it is past; and that only those who look
back upon it through the interpretation of events, can read
aright the divine idea which it enfolds.</p>

<p>This view it was that made the Apostle so bold an innovator,
and filled his Epistles with a system so different from
that of the synoptical Gospels as almost to constitute a different
religion. He had seized the profound and sublime idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that, when men are inspired, the inspiration occupies, not their
conscious thought and will, but their unconscious nature;
laying a silent beauty on their affections, secreting a holy
wisdom in their life, and, through the sorrows of faithfulness,
tempting their steps to some surprise of glory. That which
they deliberately think, that which they anxiously elaborate,
that which they propose to do, is ever the product of their
human reason and volition, and cannot escape the admixture
of personal fallibility. But their free spontaneous nature
speaks unawares, like a sweet murmuring from angels' dreams.
What they think without knowing it, what they say without
thinking it, what they do without saying it, all the native
pressures of their love and aspiration, these are the hiding-place
of God, wherein abiding, he leaves their simplicity pure
and their liberty untouched. The current of their reasoning
and action is determined by human conditions and material
resistances; but the fountain in the living rock has waters that
are divine. If this be true, then must we search for the
heavenly element in the latencies rather than the prominencies
of their life; in what they <i>were</i>, rather than in what they
<i>thought to do</i>; in the beliefs they felt without announcing; in
the objects they accomplished, but never planned. We must
wait for their agency in history, and from the fruit return to
find the seed.</p>

<p>It is not peculiar to Mr. Greg that, in estimating Christianity,
he has neglected, and even reversed, this principle. All
who have treated of it from the Protestant point of view have
done the same. They have assumed that the religion was to
be most clearly discerned at its commencement; that the divine
thought it contained would be, not evolved, but obscured
by time, and might be better detected in ideal shape at the
beginning of the ages, than realized at the end; that its agents
and inaugurators must have been fully cognizant of its whole
scope and contents, and set them in the open ground of their
speech and practical career. In the minds of all Protestants
the Christian religion is identified exclusively with the ideas
of the first century, with the creed of the Apostles, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
teachings of Christ. The New Testament is its sole depository,
in whose books there is nothing for which it is not
answerable. The consequence is a perpetual struggle between
untenable dogma and unprofitable scepticism. The
whole structure of faith becomes precarious. If Luke and
Matthew should disagree about a date or a pedigree; if Mark
should report a questionable miracle; if John should mingle
with his tenderness and depth some words of passionate intolerance;
if Peter should misapply a psalm, and Paul indite
mistaken prophecies; above all, if Jesus should appear to
believe in demonology, and not to have foreseen the futurities
of his Church,&mdash;these detected specks are felt like a total
eclipse; affrighted faith hides its face from them and shrieks;
and he who points them out, though only to show how pure
the orb that spreads behind, is denounced as a prophet of evil.
The peaceful and holy centre of religion is shaken by storms
of angry erudition. Devout ingenuity or indevout acuteness
spend themselves in vitiating the impartial course of historical
criticism; neither of them reflecting, that, if the topics in
dispute are open to reasonable doubt, they cannot be matter
of <i>revelation</i>, and may be calmly looked at as objects of natural
thought. It is a thing alike dangerous and unbecoming
that religion should be narrowed to a miserable literary partisanship,
bound up with a disputed set of critical conclusions,
unable to deliver its title-deeds from a court of perpetual
chancery, whose decisions are never final. The time seems
to have arrived for freeing the Protestant Christianity from
its superstitious adhesion to the mere <i>letter</i> of the Gospel, and
trusting more generously to that permanent inspiration, those
ever-living sources of truth within the soul, of which Gospel
and Epistle, the speeches of Apostles and the insight of Christ,
are the pre-eminent, rather than the lonely, examples. The
<i>primitive</i> Gospel is not in its form, but only in its spirit, the
<i>everlasting</i> Gospel. It is concerned, and, if we look to <i>quantity</i>
alone, <i>chiefly</i> concerned, with questions that have ceased
to exist, and interests that no longer agitate. It often reasons
from principles we do not own, and is tinged with feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
which we cannot share. Often do the most docile and open
hearts resort to it with reverent hopes which it does not
realize, and close it with a sigh of self-reproach or disappointment.
With the deep secrets of the conscience, the
sublime hopes, the tender fears, the infinite wonderings of the
religious life, it deals less altogether than had been desired;
and in touching them does not always glorify and satisfy the
heart. We are apt to long for some nearer reflection, some
more immediate help, of our existence in this present hour
and this English land, where our enemies are not Pharisees
and Sadducees, or our controversies about Beelzebub and his
demons; but where we would fain know how to train our
children, to subdue our sins, to ennoble our lot, to think truly
of our dead. The merchant, the scholar, the statesman, the
heads of a family, the owner of an estate, occupy a moral
sphere, the problems and anxieties of which, it must be owned,
Evangelists and Apostles do not approach. Scarcely can it
be said that general rules are given, which include these particular
cases. For the Christian Scriptures are singularly
sparing of general rules. They are eminently personal, national,
local. They tell us of Martha and Mary, of Nicodemus
and Nathaniel, but give few maxims of human nature, or
large formulas of human life: so that their spiritual guidance
first becomes available when its essence has been translated
from the special to the universal, and again brought down
from the universal to the modern application. They are felt
to be an inadequate measure of our living Christianity, and to
leave untouched many earnest thoughts that aspire and pray
within the mind. One divine gift, indeed, they impart to us,&mdash;the
gracious and holy image of Christ himself. Yet, somehow,
even that sacred form appears with more disencumbered
beauty, and in clearer light, when regarded at a little distance
in the pure spaces of our thought, than when seen close at
hand on the historic canvas. It is not that the ideal figure is
a subjective fiction of our own, more perfect than the real.
Every lineament, every gesture, all the simple majesty, all
the deep expressiveness, we conceive to be justified and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
by the actual portraiture: our least hesitating veneration
sees nothing that is not there. But the original artists'
sympathy we feel to have been somewhat different from ours.
They have labored to exhibit aspects that move us little; and
only faintly marked the traces that to us are most divine.
The view is often broken, the official dress turned into a disguise.
The local groups are in the way; the possessed and
the perverse obtrude themselves in front with too much noise;
and the refracting cloud of prophecy and tradition is continually
thrown between. So that the image has a distincter
glory to the meditating mind than to the reading eye.</p>

<p>All this, oftener perhaps felt than confessed, is perfectly
natural and innocent. It betrays the instinctive analysis by
which our own affections separate the divine from the human.
Paul was right in his principle, that in history <i>the divine element
lies hid</i>; is missed at the time, even by those who are
its vehicle; and does not parade itself in what they consciously
design, but lurks in what they unconsciously execute. It
comes forth at "the end of the ages,"&mdash;the retrospect of fifty
generations instead of the foresight of one. This doctrine is
true of individuals, in proportion as they are great and good.
They labor at what is most difficult to them, and make it
their end; but their appointed power lies in what is easiest.
They chiefly prize the beliefs and the virtues most painfully
won; but their highest truth dwells in the trusts they cannot
help, and their purest influence in the graces they never
willed, or knew to be their own. And it is true in history;
Paul himself signally illustrating the rule which he had applied
to earlier times. He had found, as he supposed, the
Providence of the Past, which all had missed, from Moses to
Christ; but in his turn he missed, as we perceive, the Providence
of the Future, from himself to us. The kind of agency
which he anticipated for Christ bears no resemblance to that
which his religion has actually exercised. The only fault
we can find with Mr. Thom's admirable exposition is, that he
attributes to the Apostle too distinct an apprehension of
Christ as an impersonation of <i>moral perfection</i>; and supposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the purpose of the Pauline Christianity to have been the establishment,
as sole condition of discipleship, of reverential
sympathy with the type of character realized in the Galilean
life of Jesus. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In contrast with such teachers" (the Ritual and the Dogmatic),
"St. Paul, in our present chapter (1 Corinthians ii.),
refers both to the <i>matter</i> and the <i>manner</i> of his own ministration
of the Gospel. He did not teach it as a <i>Rhetorician</i>, to
attract admiration to himself, and give more lively impressions
of Paul the Orator than of Christ the Redeemer from sin, nor
as a <i>Philosopher</i>, to raise doubtful questions on metaphysical
subjects, and become the leader of a speculative school; but
as the Apostle of Jesus Christ, he proclaimed to the hearts of
men the practical and life-giving Gospel, that 'God was in
Christ reconciling the world unto himself'; that by the universal
Saviour all distinctions were for ever destroyed, and
the whole family of God to grow into the common likeness of
that well-beloved Son,&mdash;for that now neither circumcision
availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but the renewal of the
affections after the image of the Lord. Where could an entrance
be found for party divisions in a doctrine that professed
nothing, that aimed at nothing, except to awaken the
consciousness of sin within the heart, and, through trust in
the God of holiness and love revealed in Jesus, to lead it to
repentance and life? All who felt this love of Christ constraining
them, cleansing their souls by the divine image that
had taken possession of their affections, and, through the mercy
it proclaimed, encouraging their penitence to look for pardon
from their God, must, of necessity, be one communion; for
this Gospel sentiment and hope could create no divisions
amongst those who had it,&mdash;and those who had it not were
outside the Christian pale, and, so far, could make no schisms
within it. Now, whence comes this Gospel sentiment, this
new principle of life? Were there any who had the exclusive
power of communicating it? Did it require to be introduced
by any intricate reasonings, by any subtle dialectics,
which only the Masters in philosophy had at their command?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Not so, says St. Paul;&mdash;it is a spiritual feeling, excited by
moral sympathy, as soon as Christ is offered to the hearts
that are susceptible of the sentiment;&mdash;and in whatever bosom
there is not enough of the Spirit of God to cause that
moral attraction to take place, neither philosophy nor outward
forms, nor aught else but the divine image of goodness kept
before the heart, can awaken the slumbering sensibilities
which are the very faculties of spiritual apprehension, and
which, as soon as they are alive, behold in Christ the solution
of their own struggling and imperfect existence, their ideal
and their rest. In regard to a sentiment so spiritual, a sympathy
with the image of God, where is the possibility of introducing
party divisions, and violating Christian unity? There
can be but two parties,&mdash;those that <i>have</i> the sentiment, and
those that have it not. All Christians constitute the one,&mdash;and
as for the other, in relation to Christian unity, they are
not in question. Such is the argument of St. Paul in this
second chapter."&mdash;p. 30.</p>

<p>It may be quite true that the essential power of Christianity
resides in the image, ever present to the heart of Christendom,
of a God resembling Christ, and loving those who
aspire to approach him through the same resemblance. But
we cannot find any traces of such a conception in the writings
of Paul. The "faith" on which he exclusively insisted
would be very incorrectly defined, we conceive, as a reverence
of Christ's character as morally like God. If we may
judge from the negative evidence of his letters, he appears to
have had no insight into the interior of his Master's earthly
life, and no great concern about it. There is an entire absence
of any <i>moral</i> picture of Jesus, who is presented in the Apostolic
writings as an object, not of retrospective veneration, but
of expectant reliance; not of admiring trust for personal qualities
realized in a past career, but of hope grounded on his
official destiny in the future. <i>One</i> beauty of his character is,
indeed, appealed to in the Pauline writings, viz. his humility
and self-renunciation;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> but even this is recognized, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
on historical, but on theocratic grounds; it is illustrated, not
by anything in his life, but by the fact of his death, conceived
as a voluntary postponement of his theocratic prerogatives,
and an abrogation of his exclusive nationality. He was a
"spiritual" object to the Apostle of the Gentiles, not from
perception of the inner marks and graces of his spirit, but
from his being invisible and immortal, reserved in heaven
under external escape from the conditions of earthly life.
Mr. Thom's doctrine is a happy development of modern truth
from ancient error; but regarded as a mere interpretation, it
perhaps sets down to the Apostle's account a just moral appreciation
of the past, instead of an erroneous conception of
the Providence of the future. The religion of Christ has assuredly
turned out a very different phenomenon from anything
that was anticipated at its origin. It was announced as
a Kingdom; as the king did not come, it became a Republic.
It was conceived as a State; it grew up into a Faith.
It was proclaimed as the world's end; it proved to be a fresh
beginning. It was to consummate the Law and the Prophets;
and it confounded both. It was to cover Pagan nations
with shame and destruction; it embalmed their literature, and
was transformed by their philosophy. It was to deliver over
the earth to the pure and severe Monotheism of the Hebrews;
which, however, it so relaxed as to provoke Islam into existence
to proclaim again the monarchy of God. Its subjects
were to be gathered from the Jews and half-castes of the
Eastern Synagogue; and its most signal glories have been
among the Teutonic nations, and the then unsuspected continents
of the West. In every element of its internal power,
in every direction of its external action, it has burst all the
proportions, left behind all the expectations, with which it
was born; and how can we continue to try it by the standard
of its origin? Are we to say, that, having promised one thing
and become another, it is not of God? That might be well,
if it had <i>fallen short</i> of its own professions,&mdash;disappointed us
of dreams it had awakened of glory and delight. But if it
has been <i>far better than its word</i>; if, instead of winding up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the world's affairs, it has given them a new career; if for
Messiah's tame millennium we have the grand and struggling
life of Christendom, and for his closed books of judgment the
yet open page of human history; if for the earthly throne and
sceptre of Christ, sweeping away the treasures of past civilization,
we have his heavenly image and spirit, presiding over
the re-birth of art, the awakening of thought, the direction of
law, and the organism of nations; if from the dignity of outward
sovereignty he has been raised to that of Lord of the
living conscience, not superseding the soul, but exercising it
with sorrow and aspiration; then, surely, in so outstripping
itself, the religion should win a more exceeding measure of
trust and affection. Had it only realized its first assurances,
we should have thought it divine; since it has so much surpassed
them, we must esteem it diviner. There is no reason
for the common assumption that a religion must be purest in
its infancy. It is no less surrounded then, than at each subsequent
time, with human conditions, and transmitted through
human faculties; and when delivered to the world, embodied
in action or in speech, necessarily presents itself as a mixed
product of divine insight and of human thought,&mdash;of the living
present and the decaying past; a flash of heavenly fire
on the outspread fuel upon the altar of tradition. So it is
with the Scriptures of the New Testament; which are not
the heavenly source, but the first earthly result and expression
of Christianity, and which present the perishable conditions
as well as the indestructible life of the religion. Only
by the course of time and Providence can these be disengaged
from one another, and the accidents of place and nation fall
away. If there dwell in the midst a divine productive element,
the further it passes from the moment of its nativity,
the clearer and more august will it appear. It is like the
seed dropped at first on an unprepared and unexpectant
ground; which in its earliest development yields but a struggling
and scanty growth, but each season, as another generation
of leaves falls from the boughs, becomes the source,
through richer nutriment, of fuller forms; till at length, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
it has spread the foliage of ages, making its own soil, and
deepening the luxuriance of its own roots, a forest in all its
glory covers the land, and waves in magnificence over continents
once bare of life and beauty. So is it with the germ of
divine truth cast upon the inhospitable conditions of history;
it is small and feeble in its earlier day; but when it has provided
the aliment of its own growth, and shed its reproductive
treasures on the congenial mind of generations and races, it
starts into the proportions of a Christendom, and becomes the
shade and shelter of a world.</p>

<p>Much, therefore, as we value all attempts to illustrate the
first records of Christianity, and to detach what was purely
human and transient in its original form, we think that the
religion itself cannot acknowledge the competency of such
investigations to decide upon its claims. From a verdict on
its <i>first</i> works, it has a right to appeal for judgment upon <i>the
whole</i>. It is the religion, not of John and Paul alone, but of
Christendom; without a comparative estimate of whose moral
and social genius, it can by no means be appreciated. The
weakness and inadequacy of all narrower methods of defence
will in the end drive the clergy to occupy this larger basis of
operations. And the change will be not more favorable to
the logic of their cause than to the charity of their disposition.
So long as the Scriptures alone are taken as the standard, no
more than one creed, at most, can be regarded as concurrent
with the Christian faith. But when the entire existence of
the religion through eighteen centuries is adopted as the measure,
the very interests of advocacy themselves require that
the best construction rather than the worst be put upon the
errors and eccentricities of all churches within the compass
of Christendom. The evidences would, in that case, be destroyed
by exclusiveness, and widened in their foundations
by comprehensiveness of temper; and the firmness of every
disciple's faith and the energy of his zeal would become assurances,
not of his limitation of mind, but of his largeness of
heart. Instead of endless divisions, multiplied in the search
after unity, we might hope to see the lines of separation become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
ever fainter; and every test of Christianity withdrawn
except that of moral sympathy with the spirit of Christ; a
test which, as God alone can apply it, man cannot abuse; and
according to which many that, in the ecclesiastic roll, have
been first, shall be last, and the last first.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these works, the third treats theoretically, the others
practically, of the relation of Christianity to human nature.
The preacher seeks in the natural conscience for the moral
ground and receptacle of revelation; while the historians trace
its moral operation in society and life. Were both tasks perfectly
performed, we should be furnished with a complete image
of the religion at once in its idea and its expression; should be
able definitely to compare its promise with its achievements
and to submit it, as a whole, to philosophical appreciation. But
the two halves of the subject are exhibited with very unequal
success. It is much easier to show the intended than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
actual influence of the Christian faith upon the character of
its disciples,&mdash;to determine by <i>a priori</i> methods what it <i>must
be</i>, than by an <i>a posteriori</i> induction to estimate what it <i>has
been</i>, and is. Mr. Fitzgerald, as becomes a professor of ethical
science, has well contended that the religion which he recommends
from the pulpit is neither indifferent nor supercilious
towards the morals which he teaches from the University chair,&mdash;but
assumes their obligation, appeals to their authority, and,
in its mode of reconciling the human will with the Divine,
raises them into eternal sanctities. It addresses itself to man
as a being already conscious of responsibility; and simply proposes
to restore reason and conscience to that supremacy <i>in
fact</i> which <i>of right</i> they can never lose. How far has this aim
been visibly realized? Are the traces of a Divine renovation
clear upon the face of Christendom? Is there the difference
between ancient Greece and modern England, or between the
empire and the papacy of Rome, which might be expected
between an unregenerate world and a regenerate? The historical
answer to these questions is attempted by Mr. Blakey,
with perhaps adequate resources of knowledge, but with so imperfect
an apprehension of the requisites of his argument, that
his book, though often instructive in detail, is altogether ineffective
as a whole. He is content to select and enumerate the
most salient and favorable points in the transition from ancient
to modern civilization, and to set them down to the credit
of Christianity; without care to disengage the action of concurrent
causes, or to balance the account by reference to more
questionable effects. A much finer analysis is needed, in
order to draw from history its real testimony on this great
matter; and nothing can well be more arbitrary, than to stroll
through some fifteen centuries, and, gathering up none but the
most picturesque and beneficent phenomena, weave them into a
glory to crown the faith with which they co-exist. In Christendom,
all the great and good things that are done at all will
of course be done by Christians, and will contain such share
of the religious element as may belong to the character of the
actor or the age; but before you can avail yourself of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
in Christian Apologetics, it must be shown that, under any
other faith, no social causes would have remained adequate
either to produce them or to provide any worthy equivalent.
Because Charlemagne, after baptizing the Saxons in their
own blood, displayed a better zeal by establishing cathedral
and conventual schools, <i>therefore</i> to put the horn-book of the
liberal arts into the hand of his religion, while leaving the
wet sword to stain his own; because chivalry blended in its
vow "<i>fear of God</i>" with "love of the ladies," <i>therefore</i> to
trace all loyalty and courtesy to the doctrine of the Church;
because the mediæval schoolmen imported into every science
the canons of Divinity, and decided between Realism and Nominalism
on eucharistic principles, <i>therefore</i> to give the priesthood
all the honors of modern philosophy and intellectual
liberty,&mdash;is, to say the least, very vulnerable logic and very
superficial history. Of a far superior order is the little book
"On the State of Man subsequent to the Promulgation of
Christianity." In a previous treatise, "On the State of Man
<i>before</i> the Promulgation of Christianity," the author had passed
under rapid review the ancient systems of civilization,&mdash;stationary,
progressive, aggressive; and having seized on their
characteristic features, he now brings with him determinate
points of comparison into his survey of the post-Apostolic
times. The view which he spreads beneath your eye of the
world, as it lay ready to afford a channel for the Christian
faith, is remarkable for breadth and truth. Conducting you,
with the wide picture in your mind, to the pure head-spring
in Galilee, and keeping close to the stream as it descends and
opens from these sequestered heights, he enables you to see,
reach by reach, where it fertilizes and where it destroys; the
new fields of life it enters, the old landmarks of habit it overwhelms.
The author is not more familiar with the Christian
Apologists and Fathers, than with the later Latin and revived
Greek literature from Trajan to Aurelian; and by skilfully
noting the moments when Pagan and Christian life not only
stood in silent co-presence, but came into active contact, he
brings out into clear relief the new type of character which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
formed itself within the communities of disciples. That type
is so strikingly original, its features so conspicuously express
an order of passions and ideas strange alike to the Hellenic
and the Italian races, as to betray the creative action of some
vast moral power unborrowed from the established civilization.
When the free Roman breaks the bread of communion with
slaves,&mdash;when the slippery Syrian forswears lying and theft,&mdash;when
the heedless Greek changes his eagerness of the
moment into a living for eternity,&mdash;when a people ignorant
of Stoic maxims display a contempt of torture and death sublimer
than the ideal of the Porch,&mdash;an influence is plainly
at work which has penetrated to hitherto unawakened depths
of the human soul. The phenomenon is the more impressive,
when regard is had to the materials from which the early
Christian communities were gathered. It cannot be imagined
that they were composed of elements particularly choice; and,
indeed, amid the universal corruption of morals and exhaustion
of wholesome life, it is difficult to conceive how, if the
Christian doctrine had enforced a rigorous selection, instead of
indiscriminately inviting innocence and guilt, any decent elements
could have been collected. Without adopting Gibbon's
contemptuous estimate of the body of primitive believers, we
cannot doubt that it comprised very mixed ingredients; we
know that it contained great numbers of the servile class, and
very few whose station and culture gave them access to the
higher ideas familiar to the schools of philosophy: yet from
these unpromising sources arose a society, which, in severity
of morals, in intensity of affection, in heroism of endurance,
reversed the habits of the world to which they belonged. It
seems to us an idle question for sceptical criticism to raise,
whether the religion of Christ comprised in its teachings any
ethical element absolutely new. If genius had conceived it
all before, life had not produced it till now; and the more you
affirm the philosophers' competency to think it, the more do
you convict them of inability to realize it. But in morals
scarcely <i>can</i> there be clear intellectual conception of principles
not yet embodied in living character. As in the highest works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of art, the thing seen is far other than the thing imagined and
described; not doctrines, but persons, are here the only expression
of the truth; and till they appear, ethical forms are
but as the human clay without the vital fire. In the <i>statement</i>
of thought, the early Christians, not excepting the Scripture
writers, are rude and unskilled; and a taste formed from the
study of Plato and Seneca may be offended by the rusticity of
Mark, and the abruptness of Paul. But whoever can rise
above the level of a merely intellectual critique, and embrace,
with our anonymous author, the <i>whole</i> phenomenon of the first
centuries of our era, will see a glow of self-denying faith, and
a deep movement of conscience, affording manifest announcement
of a new edition of human nature.</p>

<p>That edition has now been extant for many centuries; and
is variously legible in the literature, the institutions, the private
manners of Christendom. The Christian ideal of human
life lies as an open book before us; yet as a book so various
in its versions, and so overlaid with comments, that the fresh
flavor of its language, and even the finer essence of its thought,
are in danger of being lost. The actual Christianity of each
successive age, and each contemporary nation, is the express
result, not only in its dogma, but in its life, of two component
terms,&mdash;a given <i>matter</i>, and a given <i>faculty</i> of faith. However
full and constant the former may be in itself, the latter is
perpetually variable with the knowledge and passions of the
time, and the special genius of individual leaders; nor can
this variation of insight in the mind fail to neutralize some
portion of truth, and to give disproportionate magnitude to
others. The data supplied by inspiration itself form no exception
to this rule. Delivered into the charge of the human
soul, they fall into the moulds of its recipient nature, take
their immediate form from the laws of its life, and are reacted
on from its independent activity. The <i>immutable</i> custody of
anything by a finite thinking subject, involves the most evident
contradiction; the very contact with human intelligence reduces
universal truth to partial, the permanent to the variable,
the secure to the contingent. It is only in the essential Unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of Reason and Conscience in every age, that we find the
means of correcting the aberrations and verifying the insight
of all particular men. Not that we are to conceive of the
human race collectively as one large person, of which individual
minds are vital organs, and which has a necessary growth
and development, entitling each century to boast of advance
beyond its predecessors. We know of no spiritual units, of
no personalities, except each single and separate will; nor
do we find anything in their mutual relation which necessarily
determines them to uninterrupted improvement, and excludes
the encroachment of degeneracy and falsehood. Indeed, no
sorrier product is there of human conceit and ignorance than
the cant of "progress," which assumes that every newest phase
of thought is wisest. But if all men are endowed with radically
the same faculties, however various in their intensities
and proportions, there is a court of appeal in permanent sitting,
where the normal laws of intellectual and moral apprehension
are administered against all provincial prejudices and
transient verdicts of error. In the long run, the healthy perceptions
of good eyes will outvote the discoloring effects of
all ophthalmic epidemics, how obstinate and wide soever they
may be. And the moral vision of mankind will no less vindicate
its natural rights, by returning again and again into clear
discernments, and settled admirations, and discharging the illusory
forms and false tints of each separate age. To deny the
ethical competency of the mind for this office,&mdash;to say that
there is no power given for deciding what, among the claimants
on reverence, is really noble, true, and good,&mdash;is, with
all its pietistic pretences, an act of the profoundest scepticism,
washing away, as a quicksand, the only rock on which any
faith can be built. It is to treat the durable source of truth
as evanescent and uncertain, and shut out the possibility of all
religion. On the other hand, to set up and idolize the life and
thought of any one time as an unquestionable rule for all
times, and stereotype it for unmodified reproduction, is to treat
the evanescent as the durable, and build on whatever stands
above the water, heedless whether it be the quicksand or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
rock. Yet, strange to say, this particular superstition, and
that general unbelief,&mdash;an apparent antithesis of error,&mdash;usually
meet in the same mind, and constitute together the
chief theology of most visible churches. Having deposed and
insulted the eternal sanctities, they coax and flatter the letter
of Scripture to accept the vacant throne, and exchange the
holy modesty of its administration for a universal empire of
pretence. They drain off the springs of inspiration at their
fountain-head, and turn all history into a plain of sand, that
they may magnify their Hebrew reservoir as the world's sole
supply; forgetting that, when cut off from the running waters,
the choicest store loses its fresh virtues, and the fairest lake,
shut up without exit, turns into a Dead Sea. In contradiction
of both errors, we shall assume that transitory elements cannot
fail to mix themselves with the expression of the purest
inspiration,&mdash;the horizon of human relations and expressible
things around even the divinest soul being limited; and
that, as the inspiration tries itself upon age after age, bringing
into distinct consciousness now one side of truth and now
another, it becomes more and more possible to find its essence
and eliminate its accidents, to save its catholic beauties apart
from its sectional distortions. The Christian ideal of life is
not to be looked for in what is special to the Crusader or the
Quaker,&mdash;to Puritan or Cavalier,&mdash;to Platonists of the second
century or Aristotelians of the twelfth,&mdash;to Aquinas or
Luther,&mdash;to John or Paul; but in such sentiment as was
common to them all, and attached to them as citizens of Christendom.
When this element is disengaged from all that encumbers
it, it will be found pervading and animating still
whatever is noblest in our modern life; while all that is narrow,
and weak, and unworthy in the moral doctrine of our
age, springs from a forced attempt to perpetuate the accidental
modes of the Apostolic period.</p>

<p>Every one is sensible of a change in the whole climate of
thought and feeling, the moment he crosses any part of the
boundary which divides Christian civilization from Heathendom;
yet of nothing is it more difficult to render any compendious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
account. It is easy to enumerate in detail the phenomena
which are modified or disappear; just as on entering a
new physical region the travelling naturalist may register the
new species of plants and animals, that, one after another, present
themselves to his research. But these do not paint the
scene before even the learned eye; they are the separate out-comings
of a great life-thrill, into whose current their roots
penetrate; the landscape, as a whole, speaks differently to the
mind, and the whole heaven and earth seem pregnant with a
thought unfelt before. To read off that thought, requires an
apprehension the converse of the analytic vision of science.
The same difficulty occurs when we endeavor to seize the latent
principle of a natural realm of history. Such principle,
however, there must be. Beneath all the moving tides of
Christian thought there lie still depths that supply them all,
and a centre of equilibrium around which they sweep. We
believe that the fundamental idea of Christendom may be
described to be <i>the ascent through Conscience into communion
with God</i>. Other religions have lent their sanctions to
morality, and announced the Divine commands to the human
will; but only as the laws of an outward monarch within
whose sovereignty we lie, and who, ruling in virtue of his
almightiness, has a right to obedience, ordain as he will. Other
religions, again, have aimed at a union with God. But the
conditions of this union, dictated by misleading conceptions of
the Divine nature, have missed on every side the true level of
human dignity and peace. Manichæism, deifying the antithesis
of matter, takes the path of ascetic suppression of the
body. The Indian Pantheist, imagining the Divine Abyss as
the realm of night and infinite negation, strives to hold in the
breath and sink into self-annulment. Plato, seeing in God
the essence of thought, demands science and beauty, not less
than goodness, as the needful notes of harmony with him, and
appoints the approach to heaven by academic ways. The
modern Quietists, worshipping a Being too much the reflection
of their own tenderness, have lost themselves in soft affections,
relaxing to the nerves of duty, and unseemly in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
eternal law. Christianity alone has neither crushed the soul
by mere submission, like Mohammedanism; nor melted it away
in the tides of infinite being, like Pantheistic faiths; but has
saved the good of both, by establishing the union with God
through a free act of the individual soul. Assigning to him a
transcendent moral nature, sensitive to the same distinctions,
conservative of the same solemnities, which awe and kindle
us, it singles out the conscience as the field where we are to
meet him,&mdash;where the bridge will be found of transit between
the human and the divine. No fear or servility remains with
an obedience consisting, not in mystic acts and artificial habits,
but in the free play of natural goodness; and rendered, not
in homage to a Supreme Autocrat, but in sympathy with a
Mind itself the infinite impersonation of all the sanctities.
Nor are any dizzy and perilous flights incurred by a devotion
which meets its great Inspirer in no foreign heaven, but in
the higher walks of this home life, and misses him only in
what is mean and low. The place assigned in Christianity
to the <i>moral</i> sentiments and affections has no parallel in any
other religion. The whole faith is as an unutterable sigh
after an ideal perfection. Holiness eternal in heaven, incarnate
on earth, and to be realized in men,&mdash;this is the circle
of conceptions in which it moves. Its very name for the Inspiration
which mediates all its work, expresses the same
thing. It is not simply an ενθουσιασμος,&mdash;not μανια,&mdash;not
βακχεια,&mdash;but the πνευμα ἁγιον. The Dæmon of Socrates&mdash;the
least heathenish of heathen men&mdash;was but an intellectual
guide, and checked his erring judgment; the Holy Spirit
guards the vigils of duty, and succors the disciple's tempted
will. This profound sense of interior amity with God through
faithfulness to our highest possibility, appears in the Christian
Scriptures under two forms,&mdash;the positive and the negative,&mdash;each
the complement of the other. In the Gospel, Jesus himself,
as befits the saintly mind lifted above the strife of passion,
describes the <i>aspiration after goodness</i> as the native guidance
of the soul to her source and refuge. In the Epistles, Paul,
pouring forth the confessions of a fiery nature, proclaims the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
<i>sense of sin</i> to be the contracted hinderance that bars the ascent,
and against which the wings of the struggling will beat
only to grow faint. These representations are evidently but
the two sides of the same doctrine seen from the heavenly and
from the earthly position. Whether we are told what the
good heart will find, or what the guilty must lose, the lesson
equally recognizes the Divine authority of conscience. The
benediction and the curse are but the bright and the dark
hemisphere of one perfect truth. The Apostle, standing in
the shadow of the world's night, and regarding its averted
face, dwells on the gloom of alienation,&mdash;the "foolish heart
that is darkened,"&mdash;the "reprobate mind" from which God
is hid. Christ, conscious of the holy light, and knowing how
it penetrates the folds of willing natures, and wakes what else
would sleep, speaks rather of the glory that is not denied, and
utters that deepest of blessings,&mdash;"The pure in heart shall
see God." To this bright side also the Pauline view in the
end comes round. For though in him we miss that recognition
of a natural human goodness which gives such grace
and sweetness to many of the parables; though in his scheme
the human will has not only betrayed its trust, but hopelessly
crippled its powers; yet he does not leave it in the collapse
of paralysis, with the hard saying that it can in no wise lift
up itself, but points to a hope that bends over it from above.
The soul that is too far gone to act, may still be capable of
love; if unable to trust itself, it may trust another; if it cannot
command its volitions, it may surrender its affections; can
reverence, can aspire, can yield its hand, like a child, to an
angel of deliverance. Beyond the precincts of this world is
an Image of divine excellence and beauty,&mdash;one recently
withdrawn from human history, and soon to have a more august
return. It is but to turn the eye and give the heart to
that ideal and immortal perfection, and in the light of so pure
a love, the clouds will clear from the conscience, and lift themselves
as a nightmare away; the lame will, forgetting its infirmities,
will spring up and walk; and the restoration, impossible
by flight from deformity and ill, will come through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
attraction of a Divine sanctity and goodness. Thus does the
Apostle snatch the disciple at last into the right perceptions
which Christ assumes to be possible at first; and in both its
primitive developments the Christian religion implies the communion
of man with God through purity of heart.</p>

<p>To this sentiment, conveyed with living realization in the
person of Jesus Christ, may be referred whatever is distinctively
great in Christian ethics. Proposing, as an end within
their reach, the ascent of the soul to a divine life, and as the
means, a simple surrender to its own highest intimations, they
have melted away the interval between earthly and heavenly
natures,&mdash;not by humanizing God, but by consecrating man.
In treating the lower desires of sense and self as the steams
that intercept, the tender reverences as the clear air that
transmits, the light of lights, they have struck the deepest
truth of human consciousness. Hence the temper of aspiration,&mdash;the
earnest ideality,&mdash;the sense of infinite want, with
faith in infinite possibilities,&mdash;the sorrowful unrest in the
present, with irrepressible struggle for a better future,&mdash;which
are impressed on the poetry, the art, the social life of
Christendom. Unlike the expression of the Hellenic mind,
they are rather a prayer for what might be, than a joy in
what is. Hence, too, the predominance of the psychological
and subjective element in the philosophy of modern times,
and the conversion of the ancient "metaphysics" into the form
of "mental science." Man would never have ceased to be
merged in nature, and registered merely as a part of its contents;
his self-knowledge would not have vindicated its independent
rights; his mind would not have been recognized as
the court of record for the moral legislation of the universe,&mdash;had
not his religion taken him deep into himself, and from a
new point shown him his relation to all else; kindling his own
consciousness to a point of intense brilliancy, in correspondence
with a divine centre, which must be sought on the same
axis of being,&mdash;like the two determining foci of an infinite
curve, that find each other out, while the realm of determined
nature lies around, as the configured area, or the bounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
curve. Of the external world, indeed, <i>too</i> little account has
been made in the faith of Christians. They have not cared
to recognize it as the shrine of immanent Deity;&mdash;have
stood in uneasy relations to it; often inimical to it; sometimes
trying to get rid of it as an illusion; usually regarding it as a
foreign object, like a great statue on the stage of being, with
only stony eyes and ears for the real play of passions that
whirl around. Existence, in its essence, has been felt as an
interview between man and God, at which space and nature
have been collaterally present, but in which it was not apparent
what they had to do. Physical science and the plastic
arts may have reason to complain of the depressing influence
of this imperfect view, and of the hard necessity under which
it places them of pursuing their ends with only scanty and
grudging recognition from religion. But, for the philosophic
knowledge of human nature, and the practical regulation of
human society, this isolation of the soul within its own consciousness,&mdash;this
concentrated personality,&mdash;this vivid interchange
of life with God without diffusion through benumbing
media,&mdash;must be held eminently ennobling.</p>

<p>If, from the fundamental Christian sentiment, we descend
to the scheme of <i>Applied Morals</i> which it organized and inspired,
the principle still vindicates itself in its results. The
great problems of life are supplied from two sources,&mdash;the
<i>Persons</i> that may engage our affections, and the <i>Pursuits</i> that
may invite our will. The light in which the <i>personal</i> relations
are presented before the eye of Christendom is undeniably
benign and true. It has never been obscured without
the social spread of injustice and discontent; nor ever cleared
again, but as the precursor of reformation. That every
human soul has its sacred concerns and its divine communion,
is the simplest of thoughts; but so deep and moving, that,
where it is received and acknowledged, it calls up angelic virtues;
where it is insulted and denied, it lets slip avenging
fiends. Wherever it is sincerely held, it secures that reverential
feeling towards others, beneath whose spell the selfish
passions sleep, and without which the precept of courtesy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the definition of rights are an ineffectual form. Power loses
its insolence, and dependence its sting, where their mutual
relation does not carry the whole individuality with it, but
stops with the limits of social and political convenience, and
lies under the restraining protection of a supreme equality
before God. The "Fraternity" that is the offspring of political
theories, and aims to neutralize by fellow-citizenship
the diversities and antipathies of nature, is often the watchword
of envy and egotism, shouted by the voice of hatred, and
announcing the deed of violence. It is for want of faith in
that highest brotherhood of worship and responsibility which
Christianity assumes, that impatient schemes are formed for
artificially equalizing the weak and the strong, and abolishing
the relations of necessary dependence. Nor, where that faith
is absent, can they ever be answered so as to satisfy the <i>feeling</i>
from which they spring. They may be shown to be impracticable,
and crushed by the relentless argument of fact;
but the fact will be protested against as unnatural, and the
impossibility will seem a cruelty. How differently is this
topic handled by the logic of science and the sentiment of
religion! How much less justly does the former draw the
line between natural subordination among men and tyrannous
oppression, than the latter! Aristotle undertakes the defence
of slavery on grounds both of philosophy and of experience.
Nature, he contends, pursuing a definite end in every act of
creation, assigns to some things, from their very origin, a destiny
to rule, while imposing on others a necessity of being
ruled. Wherever a plurality of parts concur to form a general
whole, dominant and subordinate elements present themselves.
Even within the inanimate realm this is apparent, as
in the case of harmony in music. But it is chiefly conspicuous
in the sphere of animal existence; the body being, by
nature, servitor, of which the soul is lord. In the highest
stage of animate being, the constitution of well-organized men,
this law comes into the clearest light; for here the soul sways
the body with absolute command, while reason exercises over
the passions the prerogatives of a royal and constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
power; and were equality to be substituted for these modes of
subjection, mischief would ensue on all sides. Not less evidently
does Nature announce the dependence of inferior on
superior in the rank allotted to the brutes in relation to man;
and again, in the case of the two sexes, of which the male, as
the more distinguished, is rendered dominant. The same necessary
law adjusts the positions of mankind <i>inter se</i>. All
those who are as intrinsically inferior to their neighbors as
the body to the soul, or the brute to the man,&mdash;(and this is
precisely the case of the mere manual laborer,)&mdash;are slaves
by nature; and for them, as for the body and the brutes, it is
better to be servile than to be free. Any man who can be
made property of by another, and who is competent to understand
a master's intelligence without a spontaneous stock of
his own, is naturally a slave. Such a one performs functions
in the world not essentially distinguished from those of the
domestic animals; the destiny of both is to contribute their
corporeal energies to the service of society; and creatures fit
for this alone are brought into the slave-market by Nature
herself. Consistently with this conception of the laborer as a
<i>living tool</i> (δουλος εμψυχον οργανον), Aristotle lays it down that
the relation of master and slave admits no rights, and excludes
friendship. To our modern worshippers of strength, this will
appear commendable doctrine, very much because they have
themselves relapsed into the old Hellenic way of studying the
problems of the universe; descending, in the Pantheistic
method, from the whole upon the parts; fetching rules from
the wider sphere (therefore the lower) to import into the narrower;
entering the human world from the physical,&mdash;the
οικουμενη from the κοσμος; approaching society as a specialty
superinduced on a groundwork of nomadic barbarism; and
determining the functions of the individual as member of the
vital organism of the state. So long as this logical strategy
is allowed, the Titans will always conquer the gods; the
ground-forces of the lowest nature will propagate themselves,
pulse after pulse, from the abysses to the skies; and right
will exist only on sufferance from might. But there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
heaven, after all, which the most trenchant giant cannot
storm, and where justice and sanctity reserve a quiet throne.
Without disputing the inequality of gifts and consequent law
of natural ranks, religion qualifies it by an addition which
overarches and absorbs it. Were man only the choicest, most
intelligent, most gregarious of the mammalia,&mdash;were the theory
of his affairs a mere extension of natural history,&mdash;we might
reasonably discuss, in Aristotle's way, the conditions under
which he may fitly be put in harness. But there is in him an
element that takes him beyond the range of a Pliny or a Cuvier,
that lifts him out of the kingdom of nature and gives him
kindred with the preternatural and divine. He is not simply
an instrument for achieving a given fraction of a universal
end, but has a sacred trust which, on its own account, he is
empowered and commissioned to discharge. He is watched
by the eyes of infinite Pity and Affection, braced for his faithful
work, succored in his fierce temptations. The conditions
of dutiful, loving, noble life must be preserved to him. Let
his task, indeed, be suited to his powers; and if he cannot
rule, by all means let him serve; but still with a margin and
play of spiritual freedom secure from encroachment and contempt.
Those on whom Heaven lays the burden of duty no
power on earth may strip of rights. The conscience with
which the Highest can commune, the spirit which is not too
mean for His abode, can be no object of slight and scorn from
men. By law and usage you may have the disposal of another's
lot and labor; but in the reality of things the lord of a
province may be less than the conqueror of a temptation.
You may be Greek, and he barbarian; but in the heraldry of
the universe, the blood of Agamemnon is less noble than the
spirit of a saint. In thus snatching the individual, as bearer
of a holy trust, from the crush of nature and the world, Christianity
became the first <i>human</i> religion,&mdash;that absolutely took
no notice of race and sex and class. It created a new order
of inalienable rights, neither the heritage of birth, nor the
franchise of a state, but inherent in the moral capabilities of a
man. The free opening of sanctity and immortality to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
willing heart could not fail to exercise an intense influence on
the better portion of a world, like the declining empire of
Rome, sickened with corruption and confused with unmanageable
oppressions. That it did so, is proved by the whole
tenor of the early Christian literature; and the effect is well
described and accounted for by the writer "On the State of
Man subsequent to the Promulgation of Christianity."</p>

<p>"The mockery of adoring as gods the licentious tyrants
who had occupied the imperial throne, seems to have put an
end to everything like religious feeling among the nations
under the sway of Rome. The free satire of Lucianus shows
how completely it had faded away, for it introduces the gods
of Olympus complaining that they were starving for lack of
offerings; not altogether because Christian or philosophic doctrines
prevailed widely, but rather on account of the total
indifference of the people to their ancient mythology; for
even if it ever had symbolized the truth, its meaning was now
forgotten; and, even so far back as the time of Cicero, had
become totally unintelligible to the learned, as well as to the
multitude. It was useless, therefore, and wanted but a slight
impulse from without to overthrow it. But to the philosopher
who was in earnest in his pursuit of this truth, buried under
the rubbish of time, the doctrine of Christ afforded it; there
he found all that the master minds whom he honored had
taught and hoped; but he found it simplified, purified, and
confirmed by sanctions such as Plato had wished for, but
scarcely dared to expect;&mdash;to the Roman patrician, if any
there were who still looked back with fond memory to the
purer morals and stern courage of his forefathers, the Christian
simplicity of manners and firm endurance of torture and
death was the realization of what he had heard of and admired,
but scarcely seen till then;&mdash;to the slave, sighing
under oppression and condemned to homeless bondage, the
doctrine of the Gospel gave all that was valuable in life; the
Christian slave was the friend of his Christian master, partook
of the same holy feast, shared the same painful but
glorious martyrdom; he was raised at once to all his intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
rank, found freedom beyond the grave, and lived already
in a happy immortality;&mdash;to the woman, degraded in her
own eyes no less than in those of the tyrant to whose lusts
she was the slave, it offered a restoration to all that is most
dear to the human race; it offered intellectual dignity, equality
before God, purity, holiness. The Christian woman could
die; she could not, therefore, unless consenting to it, be again
enslaved to the vile passions of men; before God she was
free, and with Him she trusted to find shelter when the hard
world left her none. Can we wonder, then, that Christianity
found votaries wherever a mind existed that sighed after better
things? for the preacher of Nazareth had at last expressed
the thought which had been brooding in the minds of so many,
who had found themselves unable to give it utterance."&mdash;p.
55.</p>

<p>Nor was it merely within the pale of the Christian fraternity
that relations of mutual reverence and tenderness attested
the power of an ennobling faith. Intensity of internal combination
is often balanced, in religious brotherhoods, by vehemence
of external repugnance; and were we to accept the
fiery declamation of Tertullian as fairly expressing the spirit
of his fellow-believers, we could ill defend them from the
charge of fierce antipathy to the persons as well as the creed
of their Pagan neighbors. But many silent mercies appear
which contradict this loud intolerance. When the Decian
persecution and its attendant tumultuary movements had filled
Alexandria with such slaughter as to breed pestilence from
the bodies of the dead, the Christians, instead of sullenly permitting
the physical calamity to avenge their cause, assumed
the duties of public nurses, and performed the loathsome tasks
from which priests and magistrates had fled. Referring to
this occasion, the author just cited says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The plague made its appearance with tremendous violence,
and desolated the city, so that, as Dionysius, the Christian
bishop, writes, there were not so many inhabitants left of all
ages, as heretofore could be numbered between forty and seventy.
In this emergency the persecuted Christians forgot all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
but their Lord's precept, and were unwearied in their attendance
on the sick; many perishing in the performance of this
duty by taking the infection. 'In this way,' says the bishop,
with touching simplicity, 'the best of the brethren departed
this life; some ministers, and some deacons,' the heathens
having abandoned their friends and relations to the care of
the very persons whom they had been accustomed to call
'Men-haters.' A like noble self-devotion was shown at Carthage
when the pestilence which had desolated Alexandria
made its appearance in that city, and, I quote the words of a
contemporary, 'All fled in horror from the contagion, abandoning
their relations and friends as if they thought that by
avoiding the plague any one might also exclude death altogether.
Meanwhile the city was strewed with the bodies, or
rather carcasses of the dead, which seemed to call for pity
from the passers-by, who might themselves so soon share the
same fate; but no one cared for anything but miserable pelf;
no one trembled at the consideration of what might so soon
befall him in his turn; no one did for another what he would
have wished others to do for him. The bishop hereupon
called together his flock, and setting before them the example
and teaching of their Lord, called on them to act up to it.
He said, that if they took care only of their own people, they
did but what the commonest feeling would dictate; the servant
of Christ must do more; he must love his enemies, and
pray for his persecutors; for God made his sun to rise and his
rain to fall on all alike, and he who would be the child of God
must imitate his Father.' The people responded to his appeal;
they formed themselves into classes, and those whose poverty
prevented them from doing more gave their personal attendance,
while those who had property aided yet further. No
one quitted his post but with his life."&mdash;p. 162.</p>

<p>This self-devotion in times of distress, strangely contrasting
with habits and temper apparently unsocial, has too steadily
reappeared in every earnest church not to be accepted as a
Christian characteristic. During the fatal famine and epidemic
which desolated Antioch in the third century, the Pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
governor, when urged by the inhabitants to make authoritative
arrangements for relieving the sufferings of a perishing populace,
replied that "The gods hated the poor"; while the
Christians, prevailingly poor themselves, plunged into the
centre of the danger, and carried into the recesses of fever
and despair the quiet presence of help and hope. If disciples
have thus freely rendered to "those without" services which
Pagans refused to one another, it is not simply in stiff obedience
to a precept of love to their enemies, but from a heart-felt
sentiment of honor for human nature and consequent
tenderness of human life. There was no man who, though
he might be a persecutor to-day, might not be a comrade to-morrow;
he had a soul susceptible of consecration; and day
and night the gates of the Church were ready to fly open to
the touch of penitence; and whether he throws off the mask
of delusion or not, he must be treated as a brother in disguise.
Only by reference to this conception of all men as possible
subjects of sanctifying change, can the fact be explained, that
even where the creed has opened an infinite gulf between
believer and unbeliever, the active charities have detained
in lingering embrace the persons whom the theoretic fancy
has flung into the ultimate horrors. A religion that is
superior to the external distinctions of lineage and class, and
draws its lines only by the invisible coloring of souls, must
ever be a religion open to hope, and therefore apt to love.
Even where the severest doctrine of exclusion has prevailed,
the fundamental sentiment of Christian faith has saved the
heart from the most withering of all passions,&mdash;the blight of
<i>scorn</i>. Human nature may appear beneath the eye of an
austere believer in an <i>awful</i>, but never in a <i>contemptible</i> light.
The very crisis in which it is suspended can belong to no
mean existence. What it has lost is too great a glory, what
it has incurred is too deep a terror, to be conceivable except
of a being on a grand scale. <i>He</i> is no worm for whom the
eternal abysses are built as a dungeon and the lightnings are
brandished as a scourge. Accordingly, the very alienations
of intolerance itself have acquired a higher and more respectful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
character than in ancient faiths. The sort of feeling with
which the Jew spurned "the Gentile dog" is sanctioned by
piety no more. The Oriental curl of the lip is scarcely traceable
on the features of Christendom; and is replaced by an
expression of tragic sorrow and earnestness, where lights of
admiring pity flash through the darkest clouds.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the essential sentiment of all Christian
faith&mdash;the communion through conscience with God&mdash;carries
with it, not only noble personal aspirations, but also, towards
others, affections of singular generosity and depth; affections
which demand for every man a position in which he may
work out the moral problem of life, which dignify every lot
where this is possible, and which soften even actual alienations
with possible reverence and hope. The sphere of action
which these feelings may shape for themselves, the particular
enterprises they may undertake, the external pursuits they
may assume, will necessarily depend on many foreign and
accidental conditions. The work which it would fall to the
hands of the same faithful man to do, if he lived on through
the changes of the world, would greatly vary from age to age.
The work which contemporary men, of equal and similar fidelity,
will set themselves to accomplish, will vary with their
several positions. The same act, or even habit, which is innocent
(though possibly not innocuous) in one place, may assume
quite an altered significance in another. It would be absurd,
for instance, to set down the double marriages of patriarchal
times in the same moral rank with modern cases of bigamy.
And the doctrine of Plato's Republic respecting marriage,
startling as a comment on the manners of his age, by no
means expresses the odious state of mind which would be implied
in its substitution now for the sanctities of private life.
The devotion to studious and peaceful acts which may usually
be either blameless or laudable, may become a guilt like treason
in an hour when the interests of public liberty claim every
citizen for the council or the field. Indeed, the conduct in
such contrasted instances is in no proper sense <i>the same</i>; it
has only an external identity; it is a physical self-repetition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
with a moral contrariety; and unless, in speaking of a human
<i>action</i>, we mean to shut out the soul which makes it human,
and to denote only the muscular flourish and spasm of limb,
the sameness is but a semblance with a reality of difference.
The moral values of actions, taken in this narrowest sense, are
inevitably variable; and any code that should present a list
of them as obligatory in perpetuity, without regard to the
changes of their meaning to the mind, would mistake the
very nature of human duty. Not that we deny the existence
of permanent grounds for the adoption of some habits and
the avoidance of others. There are reasons, unchangeable as
the corporeal frame of man, why opium should not be taken
as an article of food, and why cousins should not intermarry.
But the grounds of prohibition in these cases are <i>rational</i>, not
<i>moral</i>; they are found in the outward effects, not in the inward
sources, of conduct; and only when its outward effects
are <i>known</i> to the agent, so as to enter among its inward sources
and modify its meaning, does he pass from <i>unwise</i> to <i>immoral</i>.
External action, in short, stands as an <i>indifferent</i> phenomenon,
between the mind that issues it and the world into
which it goes. The thought and affection whence it springs
in the former give its <i>moral</i>, the results to which it tends in
the latter its <i>rational</i> value. Whoever makes a correct estimate
of the several affections and impulses which stir the
will, and throughout their scale reveres the better and disapproves
the worse, possesses <i>moral</i> truth. Whoever perceives
and computes the real consequences of voluntary conduct,
possesses <i>rational</i> discernment in human affairs. The former&mdash;an
interpretation of the conscience and its sacred contents&mdash;is
the permanent essence of ethical and root of religious
wisdom. The latter&mdash;an apprehension of physical laws and
historical tendencies&mdash;is conditioned by the progress of science
and the facilities for social vaticination. Errors in <i>this</i>
are inevitable to the limitations of human intellect. Perfection
in <i>that</i> is possible only to the highest divine insight in the
soul. The fallible judgment respecting outward relations
affects only the accidents of morals, though the essence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
scientific truth. Where the inner apprehension is deep and
true, the outward judgment contains a principle of self-correction;
the miscalculation of one age is checked by that of a
succeeding; opposite errors cancel each other; and the spirit
of a pure faith, like a just feeling of beauty and greatness in
art, works itself clear of the false data of usage amid which
its inspiration arose, and transmigrates into ever-improving
forms. If, however, the reverence due to the inspiration
should become a traditional affair, losing its living eye and
spiritual tact, it will extend itself as a moping idolatry to the
imperfect media and rude materials through which the new
glory first gleamed; an incapable era of <i>renaissance</i> will
appear; the very works which were given as the spring of
ever-fresh creation will be used to stifle it; in servile imitation
of an original period, its whole character will be lost, and the
moment of exactest reproduction will be that of intensest
contrast.</p>

<p>This is precisely the way in which the spiritual life of the
primitive Christians has been dealt with. The thought and
meaning that lay at its heart are little apprehended; its applied
morals, in which these are mixed up with the errors incident
to their point of view, are distorted into a rigid code of
obligation, in which the original idea is often entirely reversed.
If it be really true that the Apostolic age was impressed
with the belief of a speedy end of the world, such an outlook
must undeniably have affected the disciples' whole estimate of
the value of human pursuits. The plan of life commendable
in a passage-ship may be questionable in a settled home; and
the proceedings of an army on the eve of battle are not like
the habits of the same people tilling their fields and sitting at
their hearths. To apply to a permanently constituted planet
the rules promulgated to preserve discipline amid a general
breaking-up, is surely an eccentric kind of legislation. Yet
by just such a process have modern churches derived a number
of ethical extravagances offensive to the eye of chastened
conscience, and condemned by their impracticability to the insincere
existence of perpetual talk. The manner in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
English divines conduct themselves towards this error of the
first century appears to us not simple and ingenuous. Some
still affect to deny it, and to treat its reiterated assertion as a
mere perverseness and impudence of heresy; yet they leave
the statement without serious refutation, though well aware
that the weight of critical authority is altogether in its favor,
and though avowing their own theory of revelation absolutely
to require that it be false. Others incidentally and grudgingly
admit it, and then pass on as if nothing had happened; immediately
relapsing into the same authoritative appeal to Scripture,
the same direct and mechanical use of its precepts, the
same assumption of it as an instrument yielding on interpretation
nothing but truth, which had been habitual with them
before their eyes were opened. Now, if anything be certain
on such a matter, it is that to suppose one's self in the world's
last year,&mdash;the admission paid to the panorama of judgment
and the spectacle only waiting to begin,&mdash;is no small and
sleepy idea, which might ineffectually turn up now and then,
and sink back below the surface without further trace. A
man who could live in presence of such a vision, and not carry
its crimsoned light upon every object that fixed his eye, could
be no apostle of truth or preacher of earnestness; nor do we
know that anything more contemptuous could be said of him
than that, no doubt, he held such an expectation, but it was of
no consequence. To convert the author of the Pauline Epistles
into a dilettante believer of the pattern of the nineteenth
century, and say of his most tremendous gleams of thought
that they were but transitory fireworks which meant nothing,
is no less an offence against his character than a misunderstanding
of his writings; and we conceive that, in affirming
the deep penetration of his mistaken world-view into the substance
of his monitory teaching, we shall be vindicating the
fundamental veracity and noble clearness of his soul.</p>

<p>To exhibit the Christology of the Apostles with the fulness
necessary for tracing pseudo-Christian morality to its origin,
would require a volume. We can only advert to one or two
points, indicating the direction which such an inquiry would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
take. It is admitted on all hands, that a second advent of
Christ is announced in almost every book of the New Testament;
that, if we except the Gospel of John, it is spoken of
invariably as a real, personal return, an objective and scenic
event, to be seen, heard, and felt; and cannot be explained
away into a spiritual access to the world, or a subjective
drama in the soul of disciples. It is further admitted, that
with this advent are integrally connected many incidents
which, however difficult to group into a complete picture, constitute,
under every variety of possible arrangement, a final
consummation of human affairs. Indeed, the article in the
Creed which declares that Christ "shall come to judge the
quick and the dead, and at his coming all men shall rise again
with their bodies and shall give account for their own works,"
shows how the Church understands the doctrine, and conjoins
the end of the world with the advent. The <i>nature</i> of the
event being so far undisputed, the question which separates
the mass of scientific interpreters from the popular expounder,
refers only to its <i>date</i>. The Apostle Paul, it is urged by the
critics, writes to his Thessalonian converts, in answer to a
distressing doubt which could have no existence but in minds
on the watch for the return of Christ; and his answer, far
from checking this outlook, raised it to such intensity that, to
soothe their excitement, he wrote to them again to remove the
event from the immediate foreground of their imagination;
yet even then detained it quite within the limits of their natural
lives, and, simply interposing one or two signals of its
approach that had not yet appeared, counselled them not to
lose their composure, but maintain a "patient waiting for
Christ." The original doubt which had disturbed them seems
to have been one instructively characteristic of the early theocratic
faith. Some member of the community had died; his
friends, in addition to their natural sorrow, were apparently
taken by surprise, that, after enrolment among the citizens of
the approaching kingdom, he was taken from their side, and
would not be with them when they hailed the arrival of Christ.
What would become of him? They thought he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
to remain in his sleep till Messiah should exercise his function
of raising the dead, which was not to be at first; and so,
during the great crisis, and for an uncertain continuance beyond,
he would linger behind the privilege which they enjoyed.
This seems, at first sight, a strange subject of distress. That
the second advent should take place in the presence of the
living only, and should leave the dead without part or lot in
the matter, is so completely at variance with the picture which
has become fixed in the common Christian imagination, that
scruples may readily be felt about attributing so mutilated a
conception to the Thessalonian church. The commonly received
picture, however, is made up of elements incongruously
brought together from several Scripture writers, to whom the
expected event presented itself under different aspects; and
nowhere can they be found combined into such a whole as the
ecclesiastical faith represents. To understand and account for
the Thessalonian state of mind, we have only to read over the
24th and 25th chapters of St. Matthew, and to surrender ourselves
to the images there presented, without adding anything
of our own. These chapters contain the fullest description of
the advent, the last judgment, and the end of the world, that
can be found in Scripture; yet <i>the dead are not brought upon
the scene at all, nor is any resurrection found among its elements</i>.
The whole idea is evidently of a return of the Son
of Man, within the limits of a generation, to take account, in
his theocratic capacity, of the very persons who had known
him in his Galilean humiliation and disguise,&mdash;of those who,
having joined him in his days of trial, had been intrusted by
him with the administration in the interval of his heavenly
absence,&mdash;and of those who, after rejecting him personally,
had hardened themselves no less against the preaching and
overtures of his subsequent ambassadors. The nations gathered
before him are furnished from the surviving population
of the earth; and the ground of their admittance or rejection
is the reception they have given to Messiah in the persons of
his missionaries and representatives. In supposing the dead
to have lost their chance of participating in this scene, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Thessalonians did but paint it to themselves as Christ, according
to the first Gospel, had described it to his hearers. Their
misgiving plainly assumes that the advent was sure for the
living and was lost for the dead. The Apostle answers by
denying the distinction, and putting both classes into the same
condition ere the great hour strikes: but <i>what</i> condition?
Does he say that the living will die first? No; but that the
dead will live first: so that the departed companion will come
back at the right moment for mingling with the troop of
friends that shall go "to meet the Lord in the air." The
same order of events is given in the sublime, but little understood,
chapter on the resurrection in the First Epistle to the
Corinthians, where the Apostle places <i>himself</i>, at the advent,
not among "the dead" that "shall be raised incorruptible,"
but among the survivors that "shall be changed" into immortals
without ever quitting life. It is a topic of praise to the
disciples at Corinth that they are "waiting for the coming of
Our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall also confirm you unto the
end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ." He assures his Philippian friends that "the Lord is
at hand," and prays that they may "be sincere and without
offence till the day of Christ." Having come out safe from
his examination and hearing at Rome, he avows his persuasion
that he will be similarly delivered "from every evil
work," and preserved unto Christ's heavenly kingdom. Though
amid his toils and weariness he earnestly desired to be endowed
with his immortal frame,&mdash;to be invested, as he expresses
it, with his house from above; yet he was unwilling
to put off the corruptible, till he could put on the incorruptible;
he would have his mortality "swallowed up of life"; he did
not wish the great hour to find him naked, but clothed, not,
that is, a disembodied spirit, but a living man. He stands at
the era on which "the end of the world has come"; and begs
his correspondents to let certain existing disputes lie over, and
to "judge nothing before the time until the Lord come." Not
less explicit evidence is afforded in the writings of other Apostles.
James says, "The coming of the Lord draweth nigh; ... behold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the Judge standeth before the door." Peter, "The
end of all things is at hand." John, "Children, it is the last
time; and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even
now are there many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is
the last time." If the author of Christianity did not himself
entertain the same expectation of an early return to assume
his Messianic prerogatives, he has been greatly misrepresented
by his biographers. For though one of them represents him
as disclaiming a knowledge of the specific "<i>day</i> and <i>hour</i>"
appointed for his "coming in the clouds with great power and
glory," the disclaimer follows immediately on his announcement,
that at all events it will take place within the existing
generation. Does any reader doubt whether this "coming in
the clouds" really describes the judgment? or whether "this
generation" denotes the natural term of human life? Both
questions are answered at once in Matthew's report of a single
sentence, which simultaneously defines the event and its date:
"For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father,
with his angels; and <i>then he shall reward every man according
to his works</i>. Verily I say unto you, there be <i>some standing
here which shall not taste of death</i>, till they see the Son of
Man coming in his kingdom." It is certainly possible enough
that the discourses in which these expressions occur may be
incorrectly reported, and have acquired from the writer's state
of mind a definiteness not belonging to the original production.
But, at any rate, they reveal the historian's conception of what
was in Jesus's thought; and the false coloring of expectation
which they threw over his prophecies could not fail to extend
in their reports to his preceptive discourses, and thus to have
almost the same influence on the recorded Christian ethics, as
if the error were his as well as theirs.</p>

<p>The evidence on this point is so positive and overwhelming,
that critics such as Olshausen, whose testimony is undoubtedly
reluctant, no longer think of resisting it. Nothing, indeed,
can be opposed to it but a kind of interpretation which is the
opprobrium of English theology; and whose problem is, not
simply to gather an author's thought from his words, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
among all <i>true</i> thoughts to find the one that will sit the least
uneasily under his words. Thus "the end of all things" is
explained away into the founding of the Christian Church;
the "coming of the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven," into
the Jewish war under Titus; the last judgment, which
"rewards every man according to his works," into the escape
of the Christians and the slaughter of the Jewish zealots at
the destruction of Jerusalem. No doubt, many good and well-instructed
men have persuaded themselves that by such exegetical
sleight of hand they could save Apostolic and other
infallibility. We can only say, that when piety supplies the
motive, and learning the means, for bewildering veracity of
apprehension, two rich and noble endowments are spent in
corrupting a nobler, which is the life of them both.</p>

<p>To the moral <i>sentiments</i> which should occupy the soul, it
may make little difference how long the world is to last. But
to the course of <i>action</i> which should engage the hand, it is a
matter of primary moment. All human occupations rest on
the assumption of permanence in the constitution of things;
nor is it less true of a planet than of a farm, that mere tenants
at will, unsecured by lease and even served already with
notice to quit, will undertake no improvements, and will suffer
the culture to decline to the lowest point. What profession
could remain respectable if society had no future? What
interest would attach to the administration of law, on behalf
of property which was not worth six months' purchase, and
life which, stripped of survivorship, had lost all sacredness to
the affections? Who would sit down to study the Pharmacop&#339;ia
on board a sinking ship? What zeal could be felt by
the statesman or general in repelling from his country an injury
that could never be repeated, or removing a grievance on
the point of supernatural death? The fields would scarce be
tilled which the angels with flaming sword might come to reap;
or the vineyards be dressed in sight of him "who treadeth the
wine-press alone." All the crafts of industry, all the adventures
of commerce, are held together by a given element of
<i>time</i>; and, when deprived of this, fall away into inanity. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
one would build a house on ice melting with hidden fires; or
freight ships over an ocean which earthquakes were to drain
away; or fabricate silks and patent-leather for appearance at
the last tribunal. And the loosened hold of these pursuits
upon human zeal, so far from implying their exchange for
anything higher and more spiritual, involves the direct reverse.
They cannot be abandoned; the stern punctuality of hunger,
the peremptoriness of instinctive or habitual want, compel
their continuance; and Paul himself made sail-cloth for a
world on its last voyage. But they are kept up only because
there is no help for it; they sink into mere bread-trades; and
are thrown back many stages from the tranquil human towards
the grim cannibal level. All work in this world, no doubt,
rests at bottom on the elementary animal requirements of our
nature; but it is then most worthily performed, not when these
requirements are most obtrusive, but when they are most
withdrawn. It is the specific moral benefit which social organization
confers upon man, that it enables him to retreat
from the constant presence of sheer necessity, and stand at a
sufficient distance from it to allow other and higher feelings
to connect themselves with his industry. It is a lower thing
to consult for the natural wants of primitive appetite, than for
the artificial love of order, neatness, security, and beauty; and
a craftsman works in a better spirit when earning some <i>unnecessary</i>
gift for his wife or child, than when toiling for the
bitter loaf that staves off starvation. An art prosecuted without
pride in its ingenuity, without intellectual enlistment in its
methods of skill, is degraded from an instrument of discipline
into a prowling for food,&mdash;from a mode of life into a makeshift
against death. To take away the future, therefore, from
secular pursuits, is simply to draw off from them whatever
redeems them from meanness; to plant them in greedy isolation,
as mere personal necessities; and cut them off from the
great human system which lends to them a color of nobleness
and dignity. Among the early Christians this tendency was
greatly checked by the fresh aims and employments which
their religion created; and in devotion to which the more enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
spirits found ample scope for their affections. The
Church, subsisting like an intrenched camp in a hostile land,
had to make sallies in all directions for rescue of the wandering,
and for captives to the faith. An aggressive activity of
compassion and conviction found tasks for the energies disengaged
from secular pursuits; and the new relations into which
their religious profession threw them towards the synagogue,
the magistrate, the Pagan worshipper, supplied them with
continual problems of conscience, severe, but wholesome to the
mind. So peculiar, indeed, was their position, that, even if
they had reckoned on a continuance of human affairs, they
could hardly, perhaps, have mingled much with a world that
drew them with such slender sympathies. Separated in ideas
and affections, they must in any case have created a new and
detached centre of social life. Still it is undeniable that their
isolation was favored and exaggerated by their faith in an approaching
end of all things; and that they withdrew from
human interests, not simply because honorable contact with
them was impossible, but because they were taught entire indifference
to them as elements of a perishing system. Not
only is no recognition given to the pursuit of art and letters,
and the citizen's duty presented only on the passive side; but
even the relations of domestic life are discouraged, and the
slave is dissuaded from care about his liberty, on the express
ground that it is not worth while, on the brink of a great catastrophe,
to assume any new position, or commit the heart by
new ties. The time is too short, the crisis too near, for the
career of a free life, or the building of a human home. It is
better for every one to continue as he is; and instead of waiting
to have the world perish from him, to regard himself as
already dead to the world. To stand impassive and alone,
neutral to joy or sorrow, with soul intent on the future, and
disengaged from impediments of the past, earnest to keep
bright on its watch-tower the beacon of faith, but resolute to
descend no more into the plain below, appeared to the Apostle
Paul the highest wisdom. And how could it be otherwise?
Seen from his point of view, all temporal claims sank into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
negation. The constitutions, the arts, the culture, of civilized
nations were about to be superseded; and the Christians who
had already retired from them needed no new ones to take
their place, except such provisional arrangements as might
serve during the world's brief respite. Equally natural and
suitable to their conceived position were the non-resistance
principles of the early disciples. What right could be worth
contending for on the dawn of a great day of redress, when
every wrong would be brought to its account? Who would
carry a cause before Dikast or Proconsul to-day, when Eternal
Justice was pledged to hear it to-morrow? Who refuse
to resign to human coercion what a retributive Omnipotence
would soon restore? When the great assizes of the universe
are about to be opened, it were a poor thing for the suitors to
begin fighting in the vestibule. In all these respects the practical
code of the Apostolic age was inevitably influenced by
the mistaken world-view prevalent in the Church. For the
plaintiff, the hour was fixed when his suit would be called; for
the slave, the emancipation-day was declared; and from him
that bound himself in heart to the past, the past was about to
be snatched away. The rules of action dictated by these notions
are mere accidents of the first age,&mdash;correct deductions
from a misconceived system of external relations. They are
wholly dependent on this misconception, and have no necessary
connection with the interior spirit, the characteristic sentiments
and affections which distinguish Christianity as a religion.
If the Apostles had lived on till their mistake had
worn itself out, and they had discovered the permanence of the
world,&mdash;had they postponed all writing of Scripture till this
lesson of experience had been learned,&mdash;we apprehend that
their scheme of applied morals would have been very different;
a more genial recognition would have been given to natural
human relations; the social facts of property and government,
the private concerns of education and self-culture, the
personal responsibilities of genius and intellect, would have
been less slightingly dismissed, and reduced to clear moral
order; and the sentences would have been greatly modified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
which now support the delusions of the improvident, the ascetic,
the exclusive, and the non-resisting. Unhappily, Apostles
do not live for ever, so that we are denied that chance; and
<i>successors</i> of Apostles, though seldom scarce, are not a helpful
race, being chiefly marks of an absent inspiration. The task,
therefore, of applying the essential Christian sentiments to a
permanent world,&mdash;though avowedly undertaken by the Roman
Catholic Church,&mdash;remains unperformed; and instead of
it we have, in the common Protestantism, a violent misapplication
to human nature and all time of the accidents and errors
of the first age, resulting, we fear, in a caricature injurious
alike to that first age itself, and to all true apprehension of
the nature and proportions of human duty.</p>

<p>Expressions abound in the literature of modern Christendom
implying an antithesis between temporal and spiritual
things, between morality and religion, between the world and
God. No one can fail to observe that this antithesis, whether
founded in reality or not, has become a social fact. There are
two standards of judgment extant for the estimate of character
and life; one set up in the pulpit, the other recognized in
the forum and the street. The former gives the order in
which we pretend, and perhaps ineffectually try, to admire
men and things; the latter, that in which we do admire them.
Under the influence of the one, the merchant or the country
gentleman is professedly in love with the innocent improvidence
of the ravens and the lilies; relapsing into the other,
he sells all his cotton in expectation of a fall, or drains his
farms for a rise of rent. On the Sunday, he applauds it as a
saintly thing to present the patient cheek to the smiter; on
the Monday, he listens with rapture to Kossuth's curse upon
the house of Hapsburg, and the Magyar vow of resistance
to the death. He assents when the Apostle John is held up
to his veneration as the beloved disciple, but, if the truth were
known, the Duke of Wellington is rather more to his mind.
Supposing it all true that is said about the vanity of earthly
pleasures and ostentations, he nevertheless lets his daughters
send out next day invitations to a grand ball, and makes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
house busy with dress-makers and cooks. He is accustomed
to confess that in him there is no good thing, and that all his
thoughts and works are only evil continually; yet he is pleased
with himself that he has provided for the family of his gardener
who was killed on the railway last week. In these and
a thousand other forms may be noticed the competition between
two coexisting and unreconciled standards, the relations
between which are altogether confused and uneasy. Whoever
is interested in following up the genealogy of ideas, and would
search for the origin of this mixed and mischievous state of
mind, must look first to the influence of Luther, and thence to
the Pauline doctrine, which he improperly generalized and
exaggerated. We will endeavor to trace the development of
the sentiment in the opposite direction, from the ancient germ
to the modern fruit.</p>

<p>Paul the Apostle proclaimed <i>Faith</i> to be the condition of
regeneration and acceptance. To appreciate this message of
his, we must remember two things;&mdash;namely, (1.) what it
was from which men were to be rescued on these terms; (2.)
what other conditions had been elsewhere insisted on instead
of this, and were put aside by Paul in favor of this. Now
enough has been said to show that what he feared for the
world which he labored to convert was, primarily, exclusion
from the theocratic empire which Messiah would return to
erect; nor is it clear what ulterior consequences, if any, he
conceived this exclusion to carry with it. This banishment
was the negative of that "salvation" to which the disciples
were called; and which consisted in their registration as qualified
citizens of the kingdom for which the earth was about to
be claimed. The picture before his mind was so far altogether
Jewish; not at all the modern idea of heaven and hell,&mdash;spiritual
regions to which individuals, one by one, pass after
death for moral retribution; but a terrestrial scene, the winding
up of history, affecting men in masses, and completing
the purpose for which God had created this world. While,
however, the thought of the Apostle's mind was national, the
compass of his heart was human; and as the hour drew nigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
he felt that the future could not be closed upon the great Gentile
world; that his own people were not so sublime a race as
to have the issues of Providence all to themselves; that he
must get rid of their conceited pedigrees, and let the Divine
plan, which for a while had narrowed its original universality
within the current of Hebrew history, flow out at its end into
the full breadth of its first scope. But if so, a new qualification
must be found; one open alike to Hebrew and to alien,
yet nursing the pride of neither. These requisites are fulfilled
in simple Faith, which, as a catholic possibility of every
human heart, Paul substitutes for prescriptive rights and untenable
merits. It was the only condition which there was
time to realize. To insist instead on a mere moral fitness, on
a character of mind suitable to meet the eye of infinite purity,
would be a mockery in a state of society at once decrepit and
corrupt. The hour pressed: it was not the case of a young
and fresh generation, that might be brought back, by heedful
training, to the sanctities of nature and conscience; but an
old and callous world, that could do little for itself, had to be
got ready in hot haste. A kindled enthusiasm, a new allegiance,
a resurrection of sleeping reverences, is the only hope.
Once fix the gaze of faith, the simplicity of trust, on the Divine
Human Being, who, having been clad in the sorrows of
this earth, waits to bring in its everlasting peace; and this
affection alone, comprehending in it every lesser purity, will
soften even arid natures, and enrich them with forgotten fertility
and grace. Preach your moral gymnastics to a school
of young heroes, whose soul is noble and whose limbs are
free; but at the baths of Baiæ, amid paralytics that drag the
foot, and cripples with worn-out bodies and halting wills, if you
cannot touch the spring of faith, you may spare your pedantic
rules of exercise. Thus the Apostle's demand of faith was a
generous stimulant of hope and recovery to an invalided
world, whose natural forces were broken, and which had but
little time for restoration. It was a provision for pouring a
mountain-breath of healing reverence upon the sickly souls
and languid levels of this world. It was an attempt to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
a quick emergency, and, by an intense action, condense the
powers of preparation. It was therefore an expression, not of
the narrowness, but of the universality of the Gospel. It
shows the great heart of the religion bursting bounds, and the
strong hand of its noblest servant tugging at the gates to get
them open, grinding off the rust of tradition and crushing the
scrupulous gravel of obstruction.</p>

<p>The doctrine, however, assumes quite a different significance
when snatched by Luther out of its historical connection, and
held valid as a sufficient theory of human nature, and its only
possibility of religion. The palsy of will, the incapacity of
self-cure, the hopeless moral prostration into which long corruption
had brought the world, as it lay beneath the eye of
Paul, Luther assumes as the normal condition of the soul, and
treats as a congenital incompetency of faculty, instead of a
contracted depravity of state. Not that he disowns the human
will as an executive power, or denies it a sphere of operation.
It can go forth variously into action,&mdash;can do what,
in the view of mankind, is better or worse,&mdash;can commit a
murder or can rescue from it; but in these outward doings,
however differently they affect men, there is no real good or
evil; in the supreme view they are neutral automatic exhibitions,
simply physical as a flash of lightning or a fall of rain;
their real character all lies in the inner spiritual springs from
which they issue in the soul: on these alone is the infinite
gaze fixed; and these are turbid all through, and all alike,
with the taint and poison of a ruined nature. As all natural
actions derive an equal guilt from the impurity of their source,
so, when the source is purified, is the guilt equally removed
from all; whilst nothing which the unconverted may do can
please God, nothing that is performed in faith can come amiss
to him. Be it what men call crime or what they praise as
virtue, it makes no difference if only it be done in faith.
Furnished with this supernatural charm, the believer may
pass through any mire and come out clean.</p>

<p>"A Christian cannot, if he will, lose his salvation by any
multitude or magnitude of sins, unless he ceases to believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
For no sins can damn him, but unbelief alone. Everything
else, provided his faith returns or stands fast in the Divine
promise given in baptism, is absorbed in a moment by that
faith."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Here is a conception of faith altogether distinct from Paul's.
It is here no act of reverential enthusiasm and affection, no
kindred movement of the soul towards an object beautiful and
holy, but a mere willingness to trust a verbal assurance of
atonement,&mdash;a willingness, moreover, itself foreign to the
mind, and superinduced as an unnatural state by special gift.
Nor is its efficacy to be sought in its transforming power on
man, but in its persuasiveness with God. It does not ennoble
anything that is the worshipper's own, but simply hangs on to
it externally the compensating sanctity of another; it is, indeed,
described by Luther as the mere vessel put into the
hands of the believer, and charged with the treasures of
Christ's obedience,&mdash;treasures so acceptable that they charm
away the foulness, and prevent the rejection, of anything that
accompanies them. Thus the effect of faith on the disciple is
not to inspire him with a God-like mind, but to prevent his
corruptions being any damage to him. By this strange theory,
both sin and sanctity are made entirely <i>impersonal</i> to man;
sin, by being a transmitted inability; sanctity, by being a foreign
donation; and his individual character sits in the midst,
at a point of spiritual indifference, neither chargeable with
the dark hue native to its complexion, nor etherealized by the
veil of borrowed light which it wears as a robe. No room is
found, either in the child of Adam, or in the redeemed of
Christ, for any responsibility, any personal guilt or goodness
whatsoever. The misery and deformity in which the Gospel
finds him is un-moral,&mdash;the mere scrofula of inheritance;
the redemption into which it lifts him is un-moral,&mdash;the mere
usufruct of an alien purity: and thus the whole business of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
religion begins and ends without approaching, and without improving,
any law of conscience at all; morality remains absolutely
cut off from its contact, unaffected by it except in being
disowned and degraded, and losing the prestige of a Divine
authority. This consequence of his doctrine is not in the
least disguised by Luther, whose impetuous audacity never
tires of forging phrases of opposite stamp, by which he may
put the brand of insult upon Morals, and burn characters of
glory into the brow of Religion. The latter, he again and
again insists, is to be set in the heavenly realm; the former,
on the other hand, detained upon the ground; the two being
kept as absolutely apart as the sky from the earth, regarded
as not less incapable of a common function than light and
darkness, day and night. Do we speak of faith and our relations
to God? then we have nothing to do with morals, and
must leave them behind lying on the earth. Do we speak of
conduct and our relations with men? then we stop upon the
ground, and get no nearer to heaven and its lights. The protests
of our better nature against our own shortcomings, the
sadness of repentance, and the alarms of guilt, so far from
being confirmed by true religion, are shown to be mere delusion
and idle self-torture; and the conscience that can feel
such compunctions is a stupid ass struggling in the dust and
flats of this world beneath a servile burden it need never bear.
To trouble the heart with any moral anxieties or aspirations is
the most fatal act of unbelief,&mdash;a downright plunge from
heaven over the precipice of hell. The moral law may rule
the body and its members, but has no right to any allegiance
from the soul.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In any personal and historical estimate of
Luther there would be much to say in palliation of these
monstrous positions; it would be easy to show their connection
with some of the noblest characteristics of his genius, and
their antagonism to some of the worst features of his times.
But regarded in their influence on Christendom, when detached
from their living origin, and made the ground of a
theory for the governance of life, they can only be lamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
as an explosion of mischievous extravagance. For in what
light do they present Morality to us, after stripping it of all
sacredness? What ground is left on which its obligation may
repose, and what end is given for its aim? It exists, as
Luther himself declares, only as a <i>provision for social order
and external peace</i>. It is not concerned with the perfection of
the individual, but with the organization of the world; and is
nothing but the system of rules and customs requisite for the
safe coexistence of many persons on the same field. It is
thus reduced from an inspiration of conscience to an affair of
police; the private sentiment of duty, operating in the hidden
recess of life, keeping vigils over the temper of the mind and
habits of the home, is a mere substitute for public opinion, and
no representative of the eye of God. In this way, moral
usages are first voted into existence as matters of convenience,
and imposed by the general voice, yielding as their product in
the individual an artificial sense of obligation; and it is a delusion
to invert this order, and say that the natural sense of
obligation, inherent in each individual, creates by sympathy
and concurrence the moral usages of mankind. This extreme
secularization of morals places Luther in curious company
with Hobbes; and the followers of both have not been altogether
unfaithful to the original affinity of their ethical ideas.
Both schools have withheld from their conception of morality
any touch and color of religion; both have been jealous of its
mingling itself much with sentiment and feeling; both have
applied to it purely objective criteria, and regarded it as a
statutory affair, susceptible of codification, and then needing
only a logical interpreter. This singular alliance between
sects regarding each other with the greatest antipathy, exhibits
the irresistible tendency of a wholly <i>super</i>-natural religion
to produce an <i>infra</i>-natural morality.</p>

<p>The result of this sharp separation of the ethical from the
spiritual province of life is, that both are deprived of elements
indispensable to their proper culture. Our devout people are
not remarkable for either clear notions or nice feelings on
moral questions; while the conscientious class are apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
dry and cold precisians, truthful, trustworthy, and humane, but
so little genial, so devoid of ideality and depth, that poet or
prophet is struck dumb before their face. Till the two classes
had discovered their mutual alienation and collected themselves
round distinct standards,&mdash;evangelical and worldly,&mdash;the
evil was inconspicuous. For some time after the Reformation,
both coexisted, without articulate repulsion, in every
church, and each silently qualified the other extreme. Besides,
in spite of Lutheran or other dogma, deep personal
faith, grateful trust in such a one as Christ, could not be
awakened in a people into whom God, whatever they might
say of themselves, had actually put a conscience, without
carrying the moralities with it. It might take the liberty of
calling them "stupid ass," but would nevertheless object to
have the ass abused. In truth, no sooner was the law of
Duty driven from Christianity, than the claim of Honor was
invoked to take its place; and the believer was exhorted not
to take unworthy advantage of his redemption from legal liability,
but to render in thank-offering the service exacted by
penalty no more; worthless as it was, it was all he had to
give. Such appeal touches a spring powerful in noble hearts,
and is, in fact, only the awakening of <i>a higher order</i> of moral
feelings than before,&mdash;a fetching back, under the disguise of
transfiguration, of that very sense of duty which had been
professedly expelled. In the first enthusiasm of faith, while
men's souls, having just flung off the sacerdotal incubus of
centuries, were burning to breathe freely, and felt the healthy
throb of a new joy, this appeal would meet a full response.
The doctrine of faith was but the appointed way of bursting
through the miserable scrupulosities, the life of petty debts
and casuistic book-keeping, by which a priesthood had maintained
a balance against the world,&mdash;of seizing a Divine
indemnity and recovering the wholesome existence of devout
instinct. If the inspiration of the sixteenth century could be
permanently maintained, if all men were equally susceptible
of being snatched up by a whirlwind of heavenward affection,
if the surprise at finding that the soul had wings of its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
could last for ever, the principle of gratitude and pious honor
might answer every end, and human duty be all the better
done by taking no security for it; for you may hurl as a missile,
in hot blood, a weight which otherwise you will scarce
drag upon the ground. But the fire of an age of Reformation
cannot be permanent; nor is gratitude an affection on
whose tension life can be securely built;&mdash;you cannot educate
people by the force of perpetual surprise. There is a
large natural order of minds, little susceptible of a self-abandoning
fervor, for whom you vainly bring the chariot of fire
and horses of fire by which prophets fly to heaven, and who
are content with the humble mantle of the humanities thrown
aside by more daring spirits in their ascent. Quiet, reflective,
self-balanced persons are not to be taken by storm, and brought
to betray the solid citadel of this world, and say ugly things
of the moralities with which they have lived in friendly neighborhood.
They are capable of being led by reverence for
what is <i>better</i>, but not of being kindled by the rays of what is
<i>intenser</i>. If they are ever to be lifted into a life <i>beyond</i> conscience,
where reluctance and resistance are felt no more, and
the instincts of affection may flow of their own pure will, it
must be by beginning at the other end,&mdash;by the <i>religious discipline
of conscience</i>, by pious consecration of this earth and
its instant work, by faithful and frugal care of the smaller
elements of duty, as of the sacred crumbs of eucharistic
bread, not without a Real Presence in them. This class,
whose religion, by a decree of their nature, can only exist under
ethical conditions, are wholly unprovided for in the Protestant
system. In the Lutheran view they belong to the
school of worldly unbelief; and though their number, as must
be the case in quiet times, has been increasing for a century
and a half, and constitutes the vast majority of educated people
in this country, they are without any recognized religion;
either veraciously disbelieving and waiting for something nobly
credible, or uneasily subsisting, suspected by clergymen,
in the midst of churches whose theory of life has ceased to be
a reality to them. With a faith traditionally shy of morals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
and morals not yet elevated into faith, we have two separate
codes of life standing in presence of each other,&mdash;one religious,
the other secular,&mdash;and neither of them with any true
foundation in human nature as a whole; the secular, an accidental
congeries of mixed customs and inherited opinions;
the religious, the product of an arbitrary spiritualism, lax and
ascetic by turns.</p>

<p>It is the peculiarity of modern Christianity that these two
codes coexist within the same social body, and even rule over
different parts of each individual. The Pauline antithesis
between the world and the Church was not less sharp than
ours; but it was a distinction of persons and classes, and nobody
could occupy both the opposite ends of it. Once within
a society of disciples, he was out of the world, and belonged
to "the assembly of the saints"; and the whole realm of heathendom
beyond constituted the contrasted term. He did not
stand and move with one leg on holy ground and the other on
the common earth; whatever were the principles of the community
he had joined, they served him all through, and did no
violence to the unity of his nature. Praying or dining, weeping
or laughing, in the workshop or the prison, he was the
same man in the same sphere. As the circle of the Church
enlarged, we should therefore expect the world to be driven
to a distance, till it was absent from whole countries and continents.
But a new "world" has been discovered, not only
within the Church, but within the person of every disciple;
his body and limbs, his business and pleasures, being under
the law of a morality quite secular; his soul and its eternal
affairs sitting apart in a love quite spiritual. Who shall draw
the line between the provinces, and know practically, hour by
hour, where he stands? Living confusedly in both, a man is
apt to acquire a sort of double consciousness, and fluctuate
distractedly between Cæsar and God. He believes, perhaps,
that the kingdoms of nature and of grace are destined always
to remain side by side, neither absorbing the other till the day
of doom. In that case, he will let other men create all the
secular usages, the moralities of trade, the maxims of politics;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
standing aloof from them as not belonging to <i>his</i> realm, and
falling in with them freely in his own case. They may be of
questionable veracity and justice; but they belong to the
Devil's world, and are as good rules as can be expected from
legislators sitting in the synagogue of Satan. Why should he
decline to profit by them, now that they are there? When
Eve has plucked the apple, it is too late for Adam not to taste
the fruit. The pious broker comes on 'Change as into a foreign
world, on which he is pushed by humiliating necessities,
and in which he feels an interest derived from them alone: he
has his citizenship elsewhere; he disdains naturalization; he
is but a temporary settler; he wants no vote about the laws;
but, taking them as they are, cuts his crop and retires. The
coolness with which people who live above the world sometimes
avail themselves of its lowest verge of usage is truly
amazing. An affluent gentleman of high religious profession,
subscriber to Gospel schools, believer in prevenient grace, and
otherwise the pride of the Evangelical heart, found himself
not insensible to the approaches of the Hudson mania, speculated
far beyond the resources of his fortune, declined to take
up his bad bargains, and thus, at the expense of utter ruin to
his agent, escaped with comparatively easy loss to himself.
The agent, being but an honorable sinner of the worldly class,
was struck down by the blow into great depression. His
employer was enabled to take a more cheerful view, and, on
meeting his poor victim, rallied him on his dejected looks and
hopeless thoughts, so different from his own resigned and comfortable
state of mind:&mdash;"But ah! I forgot," he added with
a sigh, "you are not blessed with my religious consolations!"
Where no such positively odious results as these are produced,
there is still often observable the negative selfishness of indifference
to political welfare and political morals,&mdash;an affected
withdrawal from temporal interests in the neighborhood or the
State, and an insensibility to public injustice strangely disproportioned
to the zeal displayed against innocent amusements
and the nervousness on behalf of invisible subtilties of creed.</p>

<p>The false opposition, however, between the world and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Church is not always thus passive and quiescent. It is not
always recognized by those who hold it, as being a permanent
fact to be merely sighed over and let alone. Many men are
too earnest and truthful to settle down and pitch their tent
upon a ground rocking with contradiction; to live two lives
wholly unreconciled, one in the shame of nature, the other in
the confidence of grace; or to belong to two societies,&mdash;one
political, the other spiritual,&mdash;conducted on principles at incurable
variance with each other. That a rule of action
should be secularly good and religiously hateful,&mdash;that a sentiment
should be fitly applauded in Parliament and groaned
over in the conventicle,&mdash;is to them an intolerable unreality,
like the celebrated verdict of the University of Paris, that a
doctrine might be true in philosophy and false in theology.
In their hands, accordingly, the antithesis between the human
and the divine is not a quiescent, but a conflicting dualism, in
which their religious ideas become aggressive, and assume a
commission to drive back and humble the world. They claim
the earth for God, and think the surrender incomplete while
anything natural remains;&mdash;while any instinct is uncrushed,
any laughter unstifled, any genius, however pure, a law unto
itself. The crusade against temporal interests and pursuits,
consequent upon this state of mind, changes its form with the
culture and habits of the age. In the early years of the Reformation,
when the whole Bible was spread open beneath the
thirsting eye of an undistinguishing enthusiasm, the effect
threatened at one time to be more terrible than glorious. The
full thunder-cloud of the Hebrew prophets, stealing over a
world in negative stagnation, waked the sleeping lightnings of
the soul, and for a while streaked the atmosphere of history
with fearful portents. Everything that had been written of
the chosen people, their exodus, their law, their poetry, their
passions,&mdash;everything except the relentings of their nature
and the unsteadiness of their faith,&mdash;became consecrated
alike. The military clang of their early history, the harp of
their sweet singer, the choral pomp of their priestly rule, the
mystic voices of their lonely men of God,&mdash;all were Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
music alike, often more exciting than the Sermon on the
Mount, and not less piercing than the anguish in Gethsemane.
Such was the sequence and connection of the Divine dispensations
supposed to be, that Christianity was simply the Jewish
theocracy, only let loose out of Palestine to make a promised
land of the whole world. The downtrodden serfs of
Franconia had not long heard the glad tidings from Wittenberg,
ere they began to draw parallels between themselves
and the old Israel when the desert had been passed. They
had been brought to the brink of new hope, and looked, as
across Jordan, to an inheritance verdant and tempting to their
eye. The earth was the Lord's, and the army of the saints
was come to take it; the bannered princes, the ungodly
priests, the "men with spurs upon their heels," all the carnal
who peopled this Canaan and perched their "eagle's nests"
on every height, must be smitten and cleared off. The time
of jubilee was come, when every believer should have his
field of heritage; nay, the birds in the forest, the fish in the
stream, the fruits of the ground, whatever has the sacred seal
of God's creative power, should be free to all, and the noble
should eat the peasant's bread or die. The lawyers should
take their heathenish courts away, and men of God should
sit and judge the people, according to the spirit and the word.
The harvest was ripe, when the tares must be burned in the
fire and the pure wheat be garnered for the Lord. These
were the ideas which thousands of armed men, with a clouted
shoe and a cart-wheel for their standards, and a leader who
signed himself "the sword of Gideon," preached as their Gospel
through the forests of Thuringia and beneath the citadel
of Würzburg. Nor was the ripest learning, much less the
most generous spirit of the time, any security against the
adoption of their doctrine. It was not Münzer alone who
breathed the fierce inspiration, exhorting his swarthy miners
to "lay Nimrod on the anvil, and let it ring bravely with their
strokes"; but the honest Carlstadt, too, scholar, preacher, dialectician
as he is, lays aside his broadcloth, and appears in
white felt hat and rustic coat at the cross of Rothenburg, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
preach encouragement to the people and bring fresh sorrow
on himself. Throughout the great movement which in the
third decade of the sixteenth century spread insurrection from
the Breisgau to Saxony, the peasants were animated with the
belief that the Gospel, armed with the sword of Joshua, was
to subjugate the world, and that all the conditions of property,
of law, of civil administration, under which secular communities
exist, were to be superseded by institutions conformed to
a divine model. The leading Reformers, terrified by the religious
socialism which they had raised, were ready enough
to denounce and crush it. But in truth their own idea differed
from this insurgent faith more in form than in essence; lodging
the power in different hands, and prescribing to it a different
method, but assigning to it a similar trust for the same
ultimate ends. The kingdoms of this world were to be made
the kingdom of the Lord and of his Christ; and the temporal
power was everywhere to assume a spiritual function, and
make aggression on whatever opposed itself to the severity
and sanctity of the Divine Word. The converts of Knox, the
troopers of Cromwell, the town-councillors of Geneva, acting
on this doctrine, claimed the whole of human life as their domain,
and pushed the inquisitions of police into private habits,
and even the secret inclinations of personal belief. Playing-cards
and song-books were denounced and seized, as if they
came from the Devil's printing-press; dancing prohibited, as
a profane escape of the natural members into mirthful agitation;
concerts silenced, as enslaving immortal souls to the delusive
sweetness of strings and wind; the caps of women
and the coats of men shaped to evangelic type; and, as if the
world were a great school, the gates of cities, and even the
doors of houses, were closed at temperate hours by vesper bell
or signal gun. Asceticism grasped the sceptre and the sword,
and demanded the capitulation of the world. How vain and
dangerous this tyrannous repression of nature is, the reaction
during the seventeenth century into reckless and fatal license
emphatically declares; and the contrast shows the necessity of
finding some mediating term, some reconciling wisdom, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
which the antagonism may cease between the world and heaven,
between natural morals and Christian aspiration. Yet
under a change of form the struggle is still continued; and
with those who most prominently assume to represent the
aims of Christianity, the present life, the temporal world, has
no adequate recognition of its rights. They have no trust in
human nature as divinely constituted, and as having no part
or passion without some fitting range. They dare not leave
it out of sight for an instant: they must draw up a dietary
for it, of sufficing vegetables and water; they must watch its
temper, and see that it behaves with winning sweetness to all
rascality; they must guard its purse, and teach it that to live
cheaply, spending nothing for ornament and beauty, nothing
for honor and right, but only for subsistence and charity, is
the great wisdom of man; they must stifle its indignations,
lest it should cease to hold out its cheek to Russia, and, having
gone one shameful mile with "the nephew of my uncle,"
should refuse to go with him another. Both the ascetic doctrine
and the extreme peace principles of the present day, as
well as its tendency to renounce all retributory punishment,
betray, in our opinion, a morbidly scrupulous apprehension of
evil, quite blinding to the healthy eye for good,&mdash;a crouching
of moral fear, singularly at variance with the free and
noble bearing of the Apostle, who found that "to the pure all
things are pure." As for the non-resistance principle, we
have shown that it meant no more in the early Church than
that the disciples were not to anticipate the hour, fast approaching,
of Messiah's descent to claim his throne. But
when that hour struck, there was to be no want of "physical
force," no shrinking from retribution as either unjust or undivine.
The "flaming fire," the "sudden destruction," the
"mighty angels," the "tribulation and anguish," were to form
the retinue of Christ and the pioneers of the kingdom of God.
It was not that coercion was deemed unholy, and regarded as
the agency appropriate to lower natures and left behind in ascending
towards heaven; it was simply that natural coercion
was not to fritter itself away, but leave the field open for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
supernatural. The new reign was to come <i>with force</i>; and
on nothing else, in the last resort, was there any reliance; only
the army was to arrive from heaven before the earthly recruits
were taken up. Nothing, indeed, can well be further
from the sentiment of Scripture than the extreme horror of
force, as a penal and disciplinary instrument, which is inculcated
in modern times. "My kingdom," said Jesus, "is not of
this world; else would my servants fight";&mdash;an expression
which implies that no kingdom of this world can dispense
with arms, and that he himself, were he the head of a human
polity, would not forbid the sword; but while "legions of angels"
stood ready for his word, and only waited till the Scripture
was fulfilled and the hour of darkness was passed, to obey
the signal of heavenly invasion, the weapon of earthly temper
might remain within the sheath. The infant Church, subsisting
in the heart of a military empire, and expecting from on
high a military rescue, was not itself to fight; not, however,
because force was in all cases "brutal" and "heathenish,"
but because, in this case, it was to be angelic and celestial. It
is evident that precepts given under the influence of these
ideas can have no just application to the actual duties of citizens
and states, whose problems of conduct, whose very existence,
they never contemplated; and that to urge them upon
modern society as political canons is to introduce a doctrine
which, under cover of their form, violently outrages their
spirit.</p>

<p>The mistaken antithesis between temporal and spiritual
things runs into the greatest excess, wherever the inherent
pravity of human nature is most exaggerated. There are
churches, however,&mdash;the Catholic and the Arminian,&mdash;in
whose doctrines the natural condition of man is painted in
colors far removed from the deepest shade; and which deem
him not so much incapable of right moral discernment, as
weakened for faithful moral execution. In this view, the
function of Christianity is not to supersede and cancel, but to
supplement and guide, the native energies of the soul; not to
raise it from a mad trance, in which all thought and feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
are themselves but a false glare, but to apply a tonic and healing
power, enabling it to do the right which it has already
light enough to see. Professor Fitzgerald is an adherent to
this doctrine, and justly contends that no lower estimate of
human nature can consist with responsibility at all.</p>

<p>"I am not to be ranked," he says, "amongst those who assume
that human corruption has not <i>affected</i> the natural power
of the moral sense. I think it has. No doubt sinful depravity,
wherever it is indulged, is, as Aristotle long ago remarked,
φθαρτικη των αρχων,&mdash;it tends to weaken or deprave the sentiment
of moral censure, and to blunt the perception of moral
evil.</p>

<p>"An eloquent but superficial French moralist has compared
the conscience to a table-rock in the ocean, its surface, just
above the ripple, bearing an inscription graven in the stone,
which a genius, hovering over it, reads aloud. At times the
waves arise and sweep over the tablet, concealing the mystic
characters. Then the reader is compelled to pause. But
after a while the wind is lulled, the waves sink back to their
accustomed level, the inscription stands out clear and legible,
and the genius resumes his interrupted task.</p>

<p>"This comparison might gain something in correctness if
we imagine the inscription traced upon a softer substance.
For the stormy waves of passion not only conceal, while they
prevail, the sacred characters of virtue, but, as billow after billow
passes over the tablet, they tend to obliterate the lines.</p>

<p>"But in making these large concessions, (which I do very
willingly,) I do not feel that I am surrendering the cause. It
is one thing to say that the discriminating power of the moral
judgment is <i>affected</i> and impaired by human corruption, and
quite another to say that it is destroyed. It is one thing to say
that it sometimes goes wrong, and another that we can <i>never</i>
depend on its decisions. Most men's experience has often
brought them acquainted with persons who had impaired, in
some way or other, their natural powers of perceiving truth
or excellence in some respects, without losing either sound
principles of reason or sound principles of honesty in others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
And the way to correct such obliquities of intellectual or
moral judgment is, not to tell men that they should distrust
their natural faculties altogether, but to avail ourselves of so
much as remains sound to discover the mistake or imperfection
which we seek to remedy or supply. The appeal, in such
cases, is from the reason or conscience perverted or impaired,
to the same faculties in what physicians would call their <i>normal
state</i>. When the effaced portions of the inscription are
to be restored, the evidence of the correction results from its
harmonizing with the part which has not been obliterated;
and an interpolation may be detected by its disturbing the coherence
of the context,&mdash;an omission by leaving it imperfect
or unintelligible."&mdash;p. 26.</p>

<p>On this principle alone, unhappily but little congenial with
the spirit and traditions of Protestant churches, can Christianity
coexist with natural ethics. Faith adopts morals, purifies
and sublimes them, and especially changes the character of
their force;&mdash;for a law of compulsion from below, substituting
a love of God above. The enmity ceases between the
world and heaven; the physical earth is not more certainly
afloat in space, and on the muster-roll of stars, than the present
life is plunged in eternity, and not behind its chiefest sanctities.
There is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to be
slurred over as an unmanageable necessity, in the natural constitution
and relations of men; whatever acts they prescribe,
whatever combinations they require, are within the scope and
consecration of religion. The whole compass of the world
and its affairs, all the gifts and activities of men, are brought
within moral jurisdiction, and included in the embrace of a
genial reverence. No narrow interpretation is longer possible
of the province of human piety, and the true type of a
noble goodness; as though they demanded a definite set of
actions, rather than a certain style of soul, and denied a place
to any affection or pursuit which can adorn and glorify existence.
Divine things are not put away into foreign realms of
being, and future reaches of time, attainable by no path of
toil, no spring of effort, only by miraculous transport; but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
met with every day, shining through the substance of life and
hid amid its hours. Whatever original endowments, whatever
acquired virtues, enrich and elevate our immediate sphere,&mdash;the
Thought which finds its truth, the Genius that evolves
its beauty, the Honor that guards its nobleness, the Love
which lightens the burden of its sorrows,&mdash;are not mere temporal
embellishments indifferent to its sacredness, but attributes
that bring men nearer to the sympathy and similitude of
God. Art, literature, politics, employing the highest human
activities, and constituting the very blossom and fruit of all
our culture, are recognized as having an earnest root, and not
being the light growth of secular gayety and selfishness. We
have no sympathy with the sentimental and immoral propensity,
which corrupts the newest Continental philosophy, to
recognize whatever comes into existence as <i>ipso facto</i> divine.
But we do believe that the great change for which the secret
religiousness of this age pines, and which it is sorely straitened
till it can accomplish, is the deliberate adoption into
"heavenly places" of this world, its faculties and affairs, just
as God has made them, and man's unfaithfulness has not yet
spoiled them. The products of human baseness, hypocrisy,
and ambition,&mdash;let <i>them</i> remain hateful, eternally contrary to
God, things scarce safe to pity; but believe not that they
have got this planet entirely to themselves, and have snatched
it as their <i>peculium</i> quite out of the Supreme Hand. Men
are tired of straining their thought along the diameter of the
universe to seek for a Holy of Holies in whatever is opposite
to their life; they find a worship possible, even irresistible, at
home, and on the road-side a place as fit to kneel as on the
pavement of the Milky Way. The old antagonism between
the world that now is, and any other that has been or is to
come, has been modified for them, or has even entirely ceased.
The earth is no place of diabolic exile, which the "prince of
the power of the air" ever fans and darkens with his wing;
and were it even, as was once believed, appointed to perish,
this would be not because its failure was complete, but because
its task was done. No vengeance burns in the sunshine which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
mellows its fruits and paints its grass; no threatenings flash
from the starry eyes that watch over it by night. It is not
only the home of each man's personal affections, but the native
country of his very soul; where first he found in what a life
he lives, and to what heaven he tends; where he has met the
touch of spirits higher than his own, and of Him that is highest
of all. It is the abode of every ennobling relation, the
scene of every worthy toil;&mdash;the altar of his vows, the observatory
of his knowledge, the temple of his worship. Whatever
succeeds to it will be its sequel, not its opposite, will resume
the tale wherever silence overtakes it, and be blended
into one life by sameness of persons and continuity of plan.
He is set here to live, not as an alien, passing in disguise
through an enemy's camp, where no allegiance is due, and no
worthy love is possible, but as a citizen fixed on an historic
soil, pledged by honorable memories to nurse yet nobler hopes.
<i>Here</i> is the spot, <i>now</i> is the time, for the most devoted service
of God. No strains of heaven will wake him into prayer, if
the common music of humanity stirs him not. The saintly
company of spirits will throng around him in vain, if he finds
no angels of duty and affection in his children, neighbors, and
friends. If no heavenly voices wander around him in the
present, the future will be but the dumb change of the shadow
on the dial. In short, higher stages of existence are not the
refuge from this, but the complement to it; and it is the proper
wisdom of the affections, not to escape the one in order to
seek the other, but to flow forth in purifying copiousness on
both.</p>

<p>We have said that men are tired of having their earthly
and their heavenly relations set up in sharp opposition to each
other, and are eager to live here in a consecrated world. This
tendency has already found expression in two remarkable and
apparently dissimilar phenomena,&mdash;the partial success of the
Anglican and Catholic reaction, and the vast influence on
English society of the late Dr. Arnold's character. Both
were virtual protests against that removal of God out of the
common human life, that unreconciled condition of Law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Gospel, which had made the evangelical theology sickening
and unreal. A path had to be opened for the re-introduction
of a divine presence into the sphere of temporal things. Newman
resorted to the supernatural channel of Church miracle;
Arnold to the natural course of human affairs, and the permanent
sacredness of human obligation. Both restored to us a
solemn mystery of immediate Incarnation; the one putting
life, in order to its consecration, into contact with the sacraments;
the other spreading a sacramental veneration over the
whole of life. Arnold, especially, saw the great moral evils
which have arisen from the evangelical depreciation of the
"profane" world. The secular, he was well aware, has become
<i>too</i> secular, the spiritual too <i>merely</i> spiritual. Human
nature is permitted to have play with unchecked wilfulness in
the one, and is allowed no place at all in the other. The obligations
of natural law are held in light esteem, as if, in being
social, they fell short of being sacred. The exercises of intellect,
in the survey of nature or the interpretation of history,
are often stigmatized as a mere earthly curiosity, permissible
to reason, but neutral to the soul. The worst of it is, that
these notions, once become habitual, fulfil their own predictions.
As there is nothing which the heart cannot sanctify, so
is there nothing which it may not secularize. Tell men that
in their natural affections there is nothing holy, and their
homes will soon be nests of common instinct. Assure them
that in their business it is the unregenerate will, and the animal
necessity, that labor for the bread which perisheth, and
soon enough will an irreverent greediness and a cankered
anxiety usurp the place. Persuade them that to study the
order of creation or the records of past ages is but a "carnal"
pursuit, and the student's prayer for light will become a
mere ambition for distinction, the meditations of wonder be
stifled in the dust of mental day-labor, and the tears of admiration
drop no more on the page of ancient wisdom. This
was what Arnold could not abide; to see religion flying off
on wings of pompous pretence to other worlds, and leaving
no heavenly glory upon the earth, but letting her very fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
be paved into a street. There was no attempt to save a spot
for any earnest reality, except the poor little enclosure behind
the altar rail. The Church will consecrate a graveyard for
the dead, but leaves the market of the living still unblessed:
you may dissolve away in benediction, when your years are
over of toil and sweat beneath the curse. To one who acknowledges
a natural conscience and a natural element in
faith, there is a <i>religion in little</i> in every part of life; it gives
at least a note in the chords and melody of worship. Hence
Arnold's curious doctrine of the Church as covering all human
relations whatsoever, and including the whole organism of the
State. He would have nothing which the laws of this universe
imposed on the will of man done without a clear and
pious recognition; it was not to be illicitly smuggled in, as if
run ashore in a gale of confusion that could not be helped, but
must be steadily accounted for and stored in open day. <i>Ethically</i>,
this doctrine, though, from its adaptation to a permanent
world, it is the least Apostolic in appearance, is, of all interpretations
of Christianity, the most true; and if it were not
for clinging ideas of extra-moral dogma and special priesthood,
as limiting the conception of "the Church," would go far to
repeat for our age the work of Socrates for his, and bring
down our divine philosophy from heaven to earth. It gets rid
entirely of the false spiritualism which has either withheld religious
men from political affairs, or induced them to urge on
statesmen rules applicable only where government can be dispensed
with altogether. It rescues Christianity from the degradation
of being hypocritically flattered as the great persuasive
to peace by rulers whom it does not restrain from going
to war, and relieves it of an oppressive weight of false expectation,
as though it broke its promise to the world every time
a new case of strife appeared. Nothing can well be more
damaging to a religion, than to commit it to unqualified disapprobation
of anything which must exist while human nature
lasts, and to set it frowning with ineffectual sublimity on the
passions and events which determine the whole course of history.
The amiable enthusiasts who propose to conduct the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
affairs of nations on principles of brotherly love, and who, till
that consummation is reached, can only stand by and protest,
do but weaken their country for purposes of justice and bring
their faith into merited commiseration. It is commonly said
that they are a harmless class, who may even form a useful
counterpoise to the warlike susceptibilities of less scrupulous
men. We have no belief, however, in the efficacy of falsehood
and exaggeration, or in the attainment of truth and moderation
by the neutralizing action of opposite extravagances.
The reverence for human life is carried to an immoral idolatry,
when it is held more sacred than justice and right, and when
the spectacle of blood becomes more horrible than the sight of
desolating tyrannies and triumphant hypocrisies. Life, indeed,
is just the one thing&mdash;the reserved capital, the rest, the
ultimate security&mdash;on whose disposability in the last resort,
and on the free control over which, the very existence of society
depends. The first and highest social bond is no doubt
to be found in a <i>religious</i> sentiment, a common veneration for
the same things as right and intrinsically binding on men that
live side by side; and the worship, with its institutions, of
every community, is its instinctive attempt to get these things
spontaneously done by the force of <i>reverence</i>. Could this
point be really carried, nothing would remain to be accomplished;
religion would complete and perfect the incorporation
of mutual loyalty which it had begun. But there are some
in whom the sentiment of common reverence fails, and for
whose fidelity to the moral ends of the social union there is
therefore no natural guaranty. To reach these cases, society
has no resource but coercive methods, actual or threatened;
the threat is <i>Law</i>; the actuality is <i>Punishment</i>; the power
to which both are committed is a <i>Government</i>; the commonwealth
on whose behalf they exist is a <i>State</i>. The very constitution
of a state thus presupposes the <i>possible violation of
moral right</i>, the partial failure of religion to secure its observance,
and the determination to <i>enforce</i> on the reluctant an
obedience refused of free will. Force, however, is applicable
only to men's bodies; it is a restraint and pressure on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
functions of their life; and if that life be sacred from infringement,
the political existence of nations is itself an offence
against the law of God. All law, all polity, is a proclamation
that justice is better than life, and, if need be, shall override
it and all the possessions it includes; and nothing can be
weaker or more suicidal than for men who are citizens of a
commonwealth to announce, that, for their part, they mean to
hold life in higher esteem than justice. Moreover, there is a
low-minded egotism often disguised in this doctrine of passive
meekness. As an inducement to quiet endurance of wrong,
we are reminded of the duty of "mutual forgiveness." Is all
the wickedness, then, that I am doomed to witness, nothing
but a <i>personal affront</i>? When a rascal threatens to blow out
my neighbor's brains, or to blast his character by infamous
accusations, am <i>I</i> in a position to forbear and pardon? Must
I not own myself under a solemn trust, to see the right done
and the guilty punished? Nay, would not the injured man
himself greatly mistake the nature of the crime, and measure
it by a paltry standard, if he took it for a mere private offence
which it was his prerogative to punish or to overlook? "Who
is this that forgiveth sins also?" The eternal laws of justice
are not of our enacting; and no will of ours has title to suspend
or to repeal them. The real and only demand of Christian
magnanimity is, that we visit them with no vengeance,
but merely with moral retribution;&mdash;<i>that</i> is, with no more
severity when directed against ourselves, than when we see
them at an impersonal distance. But to regard and treat the
guilty as if he were an innocent,&mdash;that is given to no man,
and is even inconceivable of God. Rulers, at all events, as
trustees of rights other than their own,&mdash;and each generation
of a people, as charged with the interests of successors in perpetuity,&mdash;have
but a limited privilege of forbearance; the
meekness of the saint would in them be treason to the world.
Even in international disputes, where each party may have a
conviction of right, the controversy, but for the possibility of
force, could have no end. It is a delusion to rely on courts as
a substitute for armies, and to suppose that judicial decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
can supersede military. The judge would be of small avail
without the constable; and the arbitrator between nations
would need a European army to enforce his decrees. Where
the stake is large and the feeling strong, it is notorious that
the private disputant rarely acquiesces in an arbitration that
goes against him; but carries his case to the last appeal,
where it is stopped by a barrier of impassable force. You
might as well pull down your jails in preparation for the assizes,
as destroy your fleets and arsenals in quest of international
arbitration. We speak only of the ultimate theory
of this matter, and simply affirm, that wherever law and government
exist, somewhere in the background force must lurk.
It may, no doubt, be provided in excess, and paraded without
need; and with the progress of a civilized order, the circle
may be ever widened within which the <i>idea</i> of coercion, with
the habits it creates, may be substituted for the obtrusive reality;
till possibly a family of nations may be gathered, like a
group of counties, into a common jurisdiction. But this only
shifts the camp without disbanding it; and, after all, the tipstaffs
of your supreme court could be no other than the legions
of a grand army. We have, therefore, no more doubt that a
war may be right, than that a policeman may be a security for
justice, and we object to a fortress as little as to a handcuff.
A religion which does not include the whole moral law; a
moral law which does not embrace all the problems of a commonwealth;
a commonwealth which regards the life of man
more than the equities of God,&mdash;appear to us unfaithful to
their functions, and unworthy interpreters of the divine scheme
of the world. Quaker histories, written with omission of all
the wars, are not less morbid as moral mistakes, than a doctrine
of Providence, leaving out the whole realm of heathendom,
is narrow as a religious theory; and the misuse of Scripture
which has led to both, is most dangerous to its authority
in an age remarkable for the breadth of its historical survey
and the variety of its ethnological sympathies.</p>

<p>In other ways than those which we have indicated has a
mischievous direction been given to modern thought and feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
by perverting the accidental and transient form of the
primitive Christianity into essential and permanent doctrine.
But our exposition must proceed no further. The alternation
of ascetic spiritualism and worldly laxity, the indifference to
natural affections and relations, the exclusiveness at once devout
and selfish, the jealous denial of their rights to intellect
and art, the false apprehension of the true dignity of law and
true life of states, have been the more earnestly dwelt upon
from the conviction that these ethical infirmities are producing
a perilous reaction,&mdash;a distrust of all ethical laws whatsoever,
a disposition to hold everything divine that finds strength to
realize itself,&mdash;a worship of what <i>is</i>, in place of an aspiration
to what <i>ought to be</i>. To this we cannot consent. We cannot
look on all forms of human life and character with the neutral
eye of an equal admiration, as alike suitable products of formative
nature. We cannot forego the right of judgment,&mdash;of
embracing with reverence or spurning with abhorrence; or
part with the ideal type of a perfect soul, to which all others
rise as they approach. Neither do we believe with Luther,
that human nature is a mere <i>devilish</i> anarchy, reducible only
by supernatural irruption; nor with the newest school, that it
is a <i>divine</i> anarchy, equally uncontrollable from within, and to
be accepted as a wild fact; but that it is a <i>hierarchy of powers</i>,
each having and knowing its rightful place, and appealing
to us to maintain it there. To listen to that appeal, and,
in answer to it, strive to harmonize the <i>de facto</i> with the <i>de
jure</i> administration of the soul, destroying the usurpation of
mean errors, and restoring the sway of kingly truth, is the
aim of morals in action and in philosophy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<blockquote class="hangind"><p><i>The Restoration of Belief</i>. No. I. <i>Christianity in Relation
to its Ancient and Modern Antagonists</i>. Cambridge: Macmillan
&amp; Co. 1852.</p></blockquote>


<p>We have heard it quoted as the remark of a distinguished
foreigner, conversant with the choicest society in several of
the capitals of Europe, that nowhere is the alienation of the
higher and professional classes from all religious faith so widespread
and complete as in England. That the masses at the
other end of the social scale are indifferent or disaffected to
the institutions which visibly embody the Christianity of our
age, can be no secret to any observant inhabitant of a large
English town. It is on the middle class alone that the various
forms of Protestant worship have any real hold. Removed
alike from the passionate temptations of the homeless
artisan, and from the mental activity of the statesman or man
of letters, the rural gentry and the urban tradespeople are
detained under traditional influences, partly by the wholesome
conservatism of moral habit, partly by helpless accommodation
to conventional standards. Men of this class, if once really
touched and possessed by earnest conviction, are the best defenders
of a religion from <i>political</i> assault. But a faith exposed
to an <i>intellectual</i> struggle finds among them but a precarious
shelter; especially if their attachment to it is less
a living persuasion than a fear of the blank which its removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
would create. Persecuted by the magistrate, they know how
to defend their worship from the oppression of law. Assailed
by the critic, they can offer but the resistance of a dumb
impenetrability; they cannot bring their sterling personal
qualities to bear upon the contest; they are obliged, for all
active conduct in the strife, to trust to a body of literary
Swiss, engaged to protect the Vatican of their faith, and accustomed
never to report defeat. In proportion as the methods
of sceptical aggression become more formidable, and its temper
more earnest, it is found necessary to improve the training
of the band of Church defenders;&mdash;a measure at once indispensable
and fatal; for it lifts them into an intellectual
position, which spoils the blind singleness of their allegiance,
discloses the hopelessness of the task expected from them,
and often destroys their antipathy to the noble revolutionary
foe. It is the vainest of hopes, that a body of clergy, brought
up to the culture of the nineteenth century, can abide by the
Christianity of the sixteenth or of the second; if they may
not preserve its essence by translation into other forms of
thought, they will abandon it, in proportion as they are clear-sighted
and veracious, as a dialect grown obsolete. The
number accordingly is constantly increasing, in every college
capable of training a rich intellect, of candidates for the ministry
forced by their doubts into lay professions, and carrying
thither the powerful influence, in the same direction, of learning
and accomplishment. The higher offices of education are,
to no slight extent, in the hands of these deserters of the
Church; and through the tutor in the family, or the master in
the school, or the professor in the lecture-room, contact and
sympathy are established between the best portions of the
new generation, and a kind of thought and culture with which
the authorized theology cannot co-exist. College friendships,
foreign travel, current literature, familiarize all educated young
men with the phenomenon of scepticism, and in a way most
likely to disenchant it of its terrors. Thus by innumerable
channels it enters the middle class at the intellectual end of
their life, assuming in general the form of historic and critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
doubt; while from below, from the classes born and bred
amid the whirl of machinery, and shaped in their very imagination
by the tyranny of the power-loom, it pushes up in the
ruder form of material fatalism. The intermediate enclosure,
safe in the dull innocence of an unsuspected creed, is growing
narrower every day; and, though reserved to the last for its
hour of temptation, will be the least prepared to win its
victory.</p>

<p>No one who appreciates the real sources of a healthy
national life, and knows what to expect from the dissolution
of ancient faiths, can look without anxiety at a prospect like
this; especially in a country whose religious institutions, rigid
with usage, overloaded with interests, charged with the bequests
of the past, are manifestly unequal to the crisis, and,
in their attempt to train the affections of the Future, wield
every power but the right one, and are indeed already regarded,
like the Court of Chancery with its wards, as a dry nursery
for grown babies. A people that reverences nothing&mdash;nothing
at least that stretches a common heaven over all&mdash;has
lost its natural unity. Incipient decay is spreading
through the secret cement of its civilization, which, far from
bearing the weight of further growth, precariously holds its
existing mass together. So far we are entirely at one with
those who see something to deplore in the "Eclipse of Faith,"
and something to desire in the "Restoration of Belief." They
do not overrate the evils of a state of society in which, if you
think with the wise, you must cease to believe with the vulgar.
We would join with them, heart and hand, in the effort
to terminate this fatal discrepancy, and find some language of
devotion and aspiration, veracious alike from the lips of the
richest knowledge and the most primitive simplicity. But
when, like the author whose publication is before us, they
would abolish the discrepancy by simply reinstating the taught
in the creed of the untaught; when they insist on the surrender
without terms of modern philosophy and criticism to the
"unabated" authority of the Bible; when they pretend to
wipe out from calculation all the theological researches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
last half-century, as if they were mere ciphers made in sport
on the tablet of history, and had no effect on our computed
place at all,&mdash;we separate sorrowfully from them, largely
sympathizing with their wish, but wholly despairing of their
method. The received theory of the origin of Christianity
from agencies exclusively divine, and of the infallible character
of the canonical books, can no more be "restored," than
Roman history can be put back to its state before Niebuhr's
time, or Greek mythology be treated as if Heyne and Ottfried
Müller had never lived. The present age is not more distinguished
by its advance in the material arts, than by its astonishing
progress in the interpretation and true painting of
the past; a Boeckh or a Grote carries in his mind a picture of
Athenian life in the days of Pericles more perfect, it is probable,
than could be formed by Plutarch or Longinus; and it
would be strange if the Christian era&mdash;certainly the object
of the most elaborated study&mdash;were the only one to escape
the work of reconstruction, or to undergo it without considerable
change. The limits of that change are at present definable
by no consentient estimate; but that they are such as to
remove the old lines of Christian defence, and require the
choice of more open ground, can no longer be denied, except
by the astute consistency of a Romanist hierarchy, and the
innocent unconsciousness of English sects. When the time
shall come for a dispassionate history of the first two centuries,&mdash;a
history which, resolving the canon back into the
general mass of early Christian literature, shall find an original
clew for tradition, instead of accepting one from its posthumous
hand,&mdash;which shall detect opinions before they were
heretic or orthodox, and trace the several streams of tributary
thought to their confluence in a determinate Christianity,&mdash;the
narrowness of our present polemic will be apparent of itself;
its fears and triumphs be regarded with a smile; and
many, both of its positive and negative results, will vanish
from the interests of religion, and be absorbed in a higher
view of the relation between the Divine and Human in this
world.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>We had hoped at first that the author of "The Restoration
of Belief" was about to take up the problem of Christianity
with a real appreciation of its altered conditions, and with unaffected
justice towards those who cannot solve it like himself.
His present essay is but the commencement of a series, designed
to arrest the progress of educated scepticism, to expose
the sophistries of modern criticism, and re-establish the plenary
authority, as oracles of faith, of the Hebrew and the
Christian Scriptures. It would perhaps be unreasonable to
complain that his argument does not march very far in this
first movement; and engages us rather by the stateliness of
its step, than by the clearness of its direction. Nevertheless,
we do think that the discursive license of introductory exposition
is carried by him to an extreme which promises ill for
the exactitude of his method. At the outset he declares that
the difficulties which embarrass modern faith go down to the
very depths of philosophy, and can be resolved only by reaching
the ultimate roots of thought. Yet he remains on the
upper surface of history, and, without once hinting how this
is to lead him to the pith of the controversy, dwells only on
facts which are undisputed, and his conception of which might
be as readily gathered from Gibbon as from Neander. Like
many writers whose eye is caught by grandeur of effect, and
whose imagination is sensitive to wonder, he is fascinated by
the moment in human affairs when the Roman Empire was
exactly poised between the forces of external unity and of
internal decay, and the political organism of the Past, so
august in its mass and its proportions, held no soul but the
young spirit of the Future. Of this crisis, assigned to the
reign of Alexander Severus, our author presents an impressive
and, we believe, a faithful sketch. Amid the splendor,
the misery, the decay of belief and hope, the universal incertitude
of that period, there emerges into notice the beautiful
and beneficent phenomenon of a real Faith,&mdash;a Faith that
can live, a Faith that can die. The inevitable conflict between
this new power and the Pagan prerogatives of the
Cæsars is well brought out by the essayist; and the victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of Christianity is justly ascribed to the peculiar character of
the religion, as a feeling directed to a <span class="smcap">person</span> rather than the
simple assent to an <span class="smcap">idea</span>. It was the force of this personal
feeling which first awakened in men the sentiment of obligation
in regard to religious truth, and substituted faithful veracity
for indifferentism and laxity of profession. The author
thus sums up the positions which he regards the present essay
as establishing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the Christian communities did, during the period
that we have had in view, make and maintain a protest
against the idol-worship of the times, which protest, severe as
it was in its conditions, at length won a place in the world for
a purer theology, and set the civilized races free from the degrading
superstitions of the Greek Mythology.</p>

<p>"That in the course of this arduous struggle, and as an
unobserved yet inevitable consequence of it, a New Principle
came to be recognized, and a New Feeling came to govern
the minds of men, which principle and feeling conferred upon
the individual man, however low his rank, socially or intellectually,
a dignity unknown to classical antiquity; and which
yet must be the basis of every moral advancement we can
desire, or think of as possible.</p>

<p>"That the struggle whence resulted these two momentous
consequences, affecting the welfare of men for ever, was
entered upon and maintained on the ground of a definite persuasion,
or Belief, of which a <span class="smcap">Person</span> was the object.</p>

<p>"That this belief toward a person embraced attributes, not
only of superhuman excellence and wisdom, but also of superhuman
<span class="smcap">power</span> and <span class="smcap">authority</span>. If we take the materials
before us as our guide, it will not be possible to disengage the
history from these ideas of superhuman dignity."&mdash;p. 106.</p>

<p>These positions we certainly conceive to be unassailable.
But they lie so completely out of the field of modern doubt
and controversy, that we are at a loss to imagine what possible
use the author can make of them. The general features
of the Christian faith, and the character of the Church, had
assumed in the third century a determinate form, about which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
there is no important question between believer and unbeliever.
Who would deny that the disciples for whom Clement of
Alexandria and Origen wrote, whom Tertullian and Minucius
Felix defended, and to whose institutes Cyprian was a convert,
believed in Jesus Christ as a person at once historical
and divine, and were strengthened by that belief to the endurance
of martyrdom? The real and only difficulties lie
higher up, in the attempt to trace the sources and earlier
varieties of this belief; and if our author can show that, in
winding its way through two centuries, and traversing several
distinct regions of thought, it dropped or rounded off no primitive
facts, and became mingled with no foreign ideas,&mdash;if he
can establish the essential constancy and uniformity, from the
first, of the tradition and doctrine which obtained ascendency
at last,&mdash;he will indeed reduce legitimate scepticism within
very narrow limits, and deserve a niche in the Valhalla of
critical renown. But if he contemplates clearing these centuries
by an argumentative leap; if, from the martyr faith of
an age later than the Antonines, he means to conclude the
certainty of the Incarnation two hundred years before,&mdash;then
we must say, he attempts a logical feat which puts to shame
the cautious steps of such reasoners as Paley, Marsh, and
Whately. The catena of well-linked testimonies, with its
bridge of safe footing, which they have endeavored to sling
across the chasm of the post-apostolic age, is but a paltry cowardice
of ecclesiastic engineering to one who can pass the gulf
upon the wing of inference. An advocate is intelligible, and
proceeds upon admitted rules of evidence, who says with
these earlier divines: "Here are the writings of Paul, of John,
of Matthew, and of other men who were present at the events
they relate or assume; whose lives were turned into a new
channel by their influence; and who went to prison and to
death rather than deny them. They positively declare that
they witnessed the most stupendous miracles, and, after their
Master had been visibly taken up through the clouds, themselves
habitually exercised the same supernatural power.
You must admit that the guaranties of testimony can go no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
further: surrender yourself therefore to the Gospel." This
is an argument which accomplishes all that is possible with
historical evidence in such a case; and were its allegations of
fact sustainable, it would still be the best form into which the
reasoning could be thrown. Unfortunately, we can no longer
feel assured that any first-hand testimony exists, as a distinguishable
element, in the narrative books of the New Testament;
so that we can regard them only as monuments of the
state of Christian tradition during a secondary period. Still,
this flaw is not repaired by striking into the course of belief
three or four generations lower down, and substituting the
"Martyr literature" of the third century for the Evangelist
memorials of the second or the first. And when our author
transfers to Clement and Origen the praise of unaffected simplicity
usually awarded to the Apostolic writers, and actually
presents it as sufficient proof of divine attributes in Christ, we
can only suppose that, in his opinion, some truths are too good
to have any bad way to them. What else can be said of the
following mode of inference?</p>

<p>"Much do we meet with in these writers that indicates infirmity
of judgment or a false taste; yet does there pervade
them a marked simplicity, a grave sincerity, a quietness of
tone, when <span class="smcap">He</span> is spoken of whom they acknowledge as <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.
If there be one characteristic of these ancient writings that
is <i>uniform</i>, it is the calm, affectionate, and reverential tone in
which the Martyr Church speaks of <span class="smcap">The Saviour Christ</span>!</p>

<p>"I am perfectly sure that, if you could absolutely banish
from your mind all thought of the inferences and the consequences
resulting from your admissions, you would not, after
perusing this body of Martyr literature, fall into the enormity
of attributing the notions entertained of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, as invested
with Divine attributes, to any such source as 'exaggeration,'
or 'extravagance,' or to 'Orientalism,' or 'enlarged Platonism.'
Exaggeration and inflation have their own style: it is
not difficult to recognize it. No characteristic of thought or
language is more obvious. You will fail in your endeavor to
show that this characteristic <i>does</i> attach to the writings in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
question; and why should you make such an attempt? There
can be no inducement to do so, unless it appears to be the
only means of escaping from some consequence which we
dislike."&mdash;p. 107.</p>

<p>Our author professedly opposes "Ancient Christianity" to
modern scepticism, because "History," as he observes, "is
solid ground," and no region of atmospheric phantasms, births
from the refracted rays of metaphysic light. History, however,
is solid ground only so far as it is really explored; and the
trending of the land and curving of the shore in one latitude
of time no more enables us to lay down the map of another,
than an anchorage at the Ganges' mouth would enable us to
paint the gorges of the Himalayas, and distinguish the real
from the fabulous sources of the sacred stream. To take us
into the basilicas and show us how Christians worshipped in
the days of Alexander Severus, to introduce us to the Proconsul's
court and bid us witness their refusal of divine homage
to Cæsar's image, and then ask us whether a faith like
this <i>could have had</i> any origin but <span class="smcap">one</span>,&mdash;this is not <i>history</i>,
but the mere <i>evasion</i> of history. We want to know, not what
<i>must have been</i> the source, but what <i>was</i> the source, of the
great moral power that rose upon the world as Rome declined.
Whoever wishes to shut out human ideas and natural agencies
from participation in the matter, must go patiently through
the entire remains of the early Christian literature; must
trace the conflict between the Hebrew and the Pauline Gospel;
find a place for the peculiar version of the religion given
by the Evangelist John; fix the limits of Ebionitism, of Chiliasm,
of Docetism; and show that these modes and varieties of
doctrine stop short of the substance of the early faith, and do
not enter the canonical Scriptures with any disturbance of
their historic certainty. Nothing of this kind do we expect
from our author. For he entertains a conception, respecting
the logic of Christian evidence, which, however prevalent
among English divines, betrays in our judgment a mind not
at all at home with the present conditions of the problem.
He seems to think that we can <i>first</i> prove the historic truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
of the Scriptures <i>in general</i>; and then get rid of the <i>difficulties
in particular</i>; and requires us, in obedience to this pedantic
law of logical etiquette, to carry into our investigation
of every successive perplexity the rigid assumption that the
writings with which we deal are "inspired," and their contents
of "Divine authority."</p>

<p>"When a collection of historic materials, bearing upon a
particular series of events, is brought forward, it will follow,
upon the supposition that those events have, on the whole,
been truly reported, that any hypothesis, the object of which
is to make it seem probable that no such events did take
place, must involve absurdities which will be more or less
glaring. But then, <i>after</i> the truth of the history has been
established, and when the trustworthiness of the materials has
been admitted, as we proceed to apply a rigid criticism to
ambiguous passages, we shall undoubtedly encounter a crowd
of perplexing disagreements; and we shall find employment
enough for all our acumen, and trial enough of our patience,
in clearing our path. And yet no amount of discouragements,
such as these, will warrant our falling back upon a
supposition which we have already discarded as incoherent
and absurd."&mdash;p. 110.</p>

<p>We cannot call this a vicious canon of historical criticism;
for it simply excludes historical criticism altogether. The
critic's work is not a process which can go on generically,
without addressing itself to any particular matters at all, and
vindicate comprehensive conclusions in blindness towards
the cases they comprise. The judgment that, on the whole,
a certain book contains a true report of events, can only be a
provisional assumption, founded on natural and childlike trust,
and can claim no scientific character, till it comes out as a
collective inference from an investigation in detail of the narrative's
contents. No doubt, the bare fact of the existence of
Christianity as a great social phenomenon in the age of the
Antonines, may afford evidence enough that Jesus of Nazareth
was no imaginary being; the genius of the religion, and the
traditional picture of its author, may indicate the cast of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
mind and the intensity of his influence; the institutions of the
Church may betray its origin in Palestine, and the approximate
date of its birth. But these conclusions, founded entirely
on reasonings from human causation, can never carry
us into the superhuman; or enable us to say more respecting
the memorials of the life of Jesus, than that they <i>may be</i> true,
and do not forfeit, <i>ab initio</i>, their title to examination by fundamental
anachronism, misplacement, and moral incongruity.
How far the existence of this <i>primâ facie</i> case falls short of
"establishing the truth of the history," and "the trustworthiness
of the materials," we need not point out to any one accustomed
to deal with questions of evidence. And as for the
great proposition, that "the Gospel of Christ is a supernaturally
authenticated gift," we cannot imagine how it is to be
proved <i>in general</i>, without research into a single miracle. Is
it indifferent to the fact of the Incarnation, that the only two
accounts of the birth and infancy of Jesus are hopelessly at
variance with each other? Is the evidence of the Resurrection
unaffected by the discrepancies on which harmonists have
spent a fruitless ingenuity? Are we as sure that, in reading
the Apostles' works, we have to do with "inspired writers,"
as if they had <i>not</i> made any false announcements about the
end of the world? What does our author mean by admitting
these things as "difficulties," yet denying them any just influence
in abatement of our confidence? He may form one estimate
of their weight, and his opponent another; but in
neither case can they be postponed for treatment in a mere
appendix to the discussion of Christian evidence: they are
of the very pith of the whole question, and, so long as they
lie in reserve as quantities of unknown magnitude and direction
of influence, render historical belief and unbelief alike
irrational.</p>

<p>Nor can we for a moment allow that the failure of ever so
many "German theories" to give a satisfactory account of
the origin of Christianity, is any good reason for contented
acquiescence in the received doctrine. Our author insists,
that we must make our definitive choice between some modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
hypothesis and the Evangelical tradition; and either take
the facts as they are handed down to us, or else replace them
by some better representation. By what right does he impose
on us such an alternative necessity? Is the critic disqualified
for detecting false history, because he cannot, at his
distance, write the true? Is it a thing unknown, as a product
of scholarship, that fabulous elements disclose themselves amid
the memorials of fact? and is it not an acknowledged gain
to part with an error, though only in favor of an ignorance?
If a modern hypothesis as to the mode in which the religion
arose may "break down" by mere internal incoherence and
improbability, why may not the ancient account, if it should
be chargeable with similar imperfections, be liable to the same
fate? It is surely conceivable that <i>all</i> the finished representations
we possess,&mdash;Hebrew and Alexandrine, as well as
German,&mdash;furnish, more or less, an ideal and conjectural
history of the infancy of Christendom; and that the reproduction
of that time may not only be <i>now</i> impossible, but have
already become so ere a hundred years were gone. The
baffling of one solution implies therefore no triumph of another;
and if the tradition on which we stand be insecure, our
position is not improved by clipping the wings of every adventurous
hypothesis on which we had thought to escape the
common ground.</p>

<p>Our author cannot then change the <i>venue</i> of the great Christian
cause from the first century to the third, and, on the evidence
present there, give even preliminary judgment. The
conflict between the new religion and the old which characterized
that period, he paints with striking and truthful effect;
and, contrasting the severe and holy veracity of martyred disciples
with the careless indifference of Paganism to religious
truth, he rightly refers the superiority of the Christians to
their faith in a <i>Person</i>, instead of mere assent to an <i>Opinion</i>.
Is it, however, correct to regard this as original and exclusive
to the Gospel, and to set it on the forehead of the Church as
the very mark of her distinctive divinity? We think not.
The same feature is manifest in Judaism, to which again it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
belongs, not as a peculiarity, but in common with every faith
whose Only God is the apotheosis of humanity. It is the one
grand moral characteristic of genuine Theism, as opposed to
Pantheism; rendering it more than the enthusiasm of poetry,
the earnestness of philosophy, the inspiration of genius, and
constituting it, in the deepest sense, Religion. Nor is the
ground of the distinction far to seek. Religion, in its ultimate
essence, is a sentiment of Reverence for a Higher than ourselves.
Higher than ourselves, however, can none be, that
have not what is most august among our endowments; none,
therefore, by reason of size, of strength, of duration; none
simply by beauty or by skill; none even by largeness of discerning
thought, but only by free and realizing preference of
the most Just and Good. A Being of living Will can alone
be nobler than myself, lift me above the level of my actual
mind by looking at my latent nature, and emancipate me
into the captivity of worship. In other words, reverence can
attach itself exclusively to a <i>Person</i>; it cannot direct itself
on what is <i>im</i>personal,&mdash;on physical facts, on unconscious
laws, on necessary forces, on inanimate objects and their relations,
on space, though it be infinite, on duration, though it
be eternal. These all, even when they rule us, are <i>lower</i> than
ourselves; they may evade our knowledge, defy our power,
overwhelm our imagination, but never rise to be our equals,
or conspire to furnish even the symbol of our God. The
mere deification of Nature, the recognition of oneness pervading
her variety, the sense of an absolute ground abiding behind
her transient phenomena, may supply a faith adequate to
the awakening of wonder and the apprehension of ideal beauty,
but not to the practical consecration of life; glorifying the
universe as a temple of Art, but railing off within it no oratory
of Conscience. In order to extract anything like a religion
of <i>conduct</i> from this type of belief, its hierophants are obliged
to approach as near as they can to the language of proper
Theism, and not even despise typographical aid for pushing
personification to the verge of personality; uttering various
warnings not to neglect the "<i>intentions</i> of Nature," or insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the "Relentless Veracities," and inviting sundry offenders to
<i>blush</i> before "the Eternal Powers." The whole force of such
expressions is evidently due to the false semblance of living
thought and will with which they clothe the conceptions of
mere abstract relations or physical tendencies. These rich
tints are no self-color, but a borrowed light reflected from a
grander Presence studiously withdrawn from view; and when
their gloss is gone, no positive residuum is found, but a doctrine
of hope and fear, without any element of Duty. It were
a mockery, an inanity, to bid a man spend his affections on
hypostatized laws that neither know nor answer him. In his
crimes, it is not the heavy irons of his prison, but the deep
eye of his judge, from which he shrinks; and in his repentance
he weeps, not upon the lap of Nature, but at the feet of God.
In his allegiance, his vow is made, not to the certainty of
facts, but to the majesty of Right, and the authority of an Infinitely
Just; and his acts of trust are directed by no means
to the steadiness of creation's ways, but to the faithfulness of
a perfect Mind. In short, all the sentiments characteristic
of religion presuppose a Personal Object, and assert their
power only where Manhood is the type of Godhead. This
condition was imported, or rather continued, from the Hebrew
to the Christian system; and brought with it the devout loyalty
of heart, the singleness of service, the incorruptible heroism
of endurance, which had encountered Antiochus Epiphanes
at Jerusalem, as it now met Pliny in Bithynia, and
Quadratus at Smyrna. The Paganism of the Empire, on the
other hand, failed entirely of this condition. It was a mere
nature-worship, expressive of the political dynamics by which,
through the award of a mysterious necessity, Rome had become
the centre of the world. If, among the deities whose
congress was now assembled on the Tiber, there were any
which once, in their indigenous seats, had commanded the full
moral faith, and touched the true theistic devotion, of a people,
that time had passed; and the conquered tribes suffered
a more fatal loss when the victorious city adopted their religion,
than when she crushed their liberty. Removed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Rome, the rites of a provincial worship expressed nothing
except that its gods were gods no more, but had descended
from divine monarchic rights to a place among a pensioned
hierarchy. Vanquished divinities inevitably become delegated
powers of nature, and resign their sceptre to the sovereign
they are compelled to own. As the administration of the Empire
embraced a congeries of checked nationalities, so did its
pantheon include a collection of extinguished religions. While
as Imperator the head of the state was the embodiment of its
unity by natural force, as Divus he represented its unity by
preternatural sanction; and the divine honors paid to him
were the acknowledgment of a necessity more than human
in the culminating majesty of Rome. These honors would
be freely rendered to him by those who looked on all realized
existence, on everything charged with force enough to come
up and be, as equally decreed by "the Eternal Powers,"&mdash;equally
divine. Such homage would appear to them the
mere expression of a fact, and a graceful owning of mysterious
fates in its production; and no scruple could withhold
them from an act which contradicted nothing in their mind,
and did but fling a breath of pious incense around the thing
that veritably was. It were absurd to expect the protest of
a martyr from a man whose religion you cannot contradict;
who will see a God wherever you ask him; and whose worship
asserts nothing but that, a phenomenon being there, an
occult power is behind it. A faith of this sort is deficient, as
an Hegelian would say, "in the moment of <i>negation</i>"; it is
all unobstructed affirmation, and can strike no light because
it thus finds nothing to dash itself against. But let the divine
element in the universe cease to be impersonal and impartially
coalescent with the whole, let it live an Individual Mind,
and the requisite antagonism immediately appears. To the
Jew, the worship of Cæsar would be no other than high treason
to Jehovah, whose tool, whose whip of lightning, and
whose cup of consolation the Pagan Emperor might become;
but whose emblem and incarnation he could so little be, that
he rather stood defiantly at the head of the opposing realm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
and, even when forced to be the organ, did not cease to be
the competitor of God. For <i>opposing realm</i> there must be,
wherever proper Theism exists. Man feels that his personal
attributes, his will, his character, his conscience, demand conflict
for their condition, and without the possibility of ill could
never be; and when he carries them out into the infinite region,
to serve as his image of the Highest, they bear with
them the inseparable shadow of evil, and give it place in the
universe, as the darkness in whose absence light would want
its distinction, the privative without which the beauty of holiness
were nothing positive. Hence, expressed or unexpressed,
a dualism mingles with all genuine theistic faith. All is not
divine for it. It has a devil's province somewhere. Face to
face, as Ebal to Gerizim, the frown of blighted rock to the
smile of verdant heights,&mdash;hostile as the priest of falsehood
to the true prophet,&mdash;there stand contrasted in this creed
two domains of the world,&mdash;one surrendered to insurgent
powers, the other reserved as the nursing ground from which
right and truth shall be spread. To the Hebrew, the Pagan
world was given over to a false allegiance, and inspired with
diabolical delusions. For him to sacrifice to the genius of
Cæsar, would have been, therefore, a desertion to the enemies
of God, forbidden by every claim of faithfulness and veracity.
Thus we conceive that the moral conditions of the martyrs'
protest against idol-worships were complete within the limits
of Judaism before the mission of Christ; and that the essence
of it lies, not in the exclusive characteristics of the Gospel,
but in the difference between Theistic reverence for a Personal
Being, and the Pantheistic acknowledgment of an impersonal
divineness. The peculiar function of Christianity
in this respect was to become missionary to the world of this
heroic fidelity transmitted from the parent faith, and hitherto
bounded by its limits; and to find a place in the universal
conscience of civilized nations for the duty of bearing testimony,
though with tortures and death, to the pricelessness of
truth and the sanctity of conviction. True it is that the Gospel
was qualified for this office by directing human faith upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
a <i>Person</i>; and would have exercised no such power, had it
been a mere philosophy presenting propositions for assent,
instead of a Living Mind for trust and reverence. But this
condition would have been attained by the simple extension
of the Jewish Theism. The Personality, which is needed as
a centre of intense fealty and affection, is found in the God
of Hebrew tradition, and, for its effects in kindling a martyr
courage and constancy, did not require to be sought in the
historical Jesus of Nazareth. He, no doubt, as the mediate
expression of the Supreme Will, as the Being with whom
the Church stood in direct contact, as the presence of the
Divine in the Human, <i>was</i> the object of the disciples' actual
allegiance. We do not in the least question this as a <i>fact</i>,
but only as a <i>necessity</i>, ere we can account for the moral features
of a martyr age.</p>

<p>In singling out, as one of the grandest practical results of
Christianity, the recognition it has obtained for the <i>obligations
of religious truth</i>, our author has rightly seized a characteristic
distinction of modern from ancient society. The
principle is a real agency of the first order in history; we do
not accuse him of overrating its importance, but of mistaking
its genealogy. And now we must add, that if we differ from
him as to the source whence it comes, we differ still more as
to the issues whither it conducts. So inconsiderately does he
allow himself to be borne away by his evangelical zeal, that he
claims for the Gospel, not only the glory of first revealing, but
the exclusive right of ever practising, the duties of religious
veracity. None but historical believers have the least title
to attach any sacredness to their convictions, or to feel any hesitation
about denying them. What business have the authors
of the "Phases of Faith," and the "Creed of Christendom,"
to any better morality of belief than Gallio or Lucian? If
they have not fallen back into the Pagan indifferentism, they
<i>ought</i> to have done so, and our author will continue very indignant
till they do. He is offended with Mr. Newman for
asking judgment on his "argument and himself, as before
the bar of God"; and with Mr. Greg for saying that, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
process of changing cherished beliefs, "the pursuit of truth is
a daily martyrdom," and for giving "honor to those who encounter
it, saddened, weeping, trembling, but unflinching still!"
And he is not ashamed to declare that the guileless veracity
which in himself would be a martyr's constancy, would be in
another an overweening conceit. So astonishing, logically
and ethically, are his statements on this subject, and so curiously
do they determine his intellectual position, that we
must present them in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We Christian men of this age, along with our venerated
martyr brethren of the ancient Church, in making this profession,&mdash;that
we may not lie to God, nor deny before men our
inward conviction in matters of religion; we (as they did)
affirm that which is consistent within itself, and which, in the
whole extent of its meaning, is certain and is reasonable, grant
us only our initial postulate, that Christianity is from heaven.</p>

<p>"But how is it, when this same solemn averment comes
from the lips of those who deny that postulate, and who scorn
to recognize the voice of God in the <span class="smcap">Book</span>? It is just thus;
and those whom it concerns so to do, owe it to the world and
to themselves to make the ingenuous avowal.</p>

<p>"In the first place, the style and the very terms employed
by these writers in enouncing the fact of the martyrdom they
are undergoing, are all a flagrant plagiarism, and nothing better!
A claim, in behalf of the Gospel, must be made of what
is its own, and which these writers, without leave asked, have
appropriated. As to every word and phrase upon which the
significance of this their profession turns, it must be given up,
leaving them in possession of so much only of the meaning of
such phrases as would have been intelligible to <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, to
<span class="smcap">Porphyry</span>, and to <span class="smcap">M. Aurelius</span>. A surrender must be
made of the words <span class="smcap">Conscience</span>, and <span class="smcap">Truth</span>, and <span class="smcap">Righteousness</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Sin</span>; and, alas! modern unbelievers must be
challenged to give me back that <span class="smcap">one</span> awe-fraught <span class="smcap">Name</span>
which they (must I not plainly say so?) have stolen out of
the <span class="smcap">Book</span>; when they have frankly made this large surrender,
we may return to them the το θειον of classical antiquity.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet this plagiarism, as to terms, is the smaller part of
that invasion of rights with which the same persons are
chargeable. It is reasonable, and it is what a good man <i>must</i>
do, to suffer anything rather than deny a persuasion, which
is such that he could not, if he would, cast it off. So it was
with the early Christian martyrs; their persuasion of the
truth of the Gospel had become part of themselves; it was
faith absolute, in the fullest sense of the word. The same
degree of irresistible persuasion attaches to the conclusions of
mathematical or physical science; but it can never belong to
an opinion, or to an undefined abstract belief. A man may
indeed choose to die rather than contradict his personal persuasion
of the truth of an opinion; but in doing so he has no
right to take to himself the martyr's style. So to speak is to
exhibit, not constancy, but opinionativeness, or an overweening
confidence in his own reasoning faculty.</p>

<p>"Polycarp could not have refused to die when the only
alternative was to blaspheme <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, his Lord; but Plutarch
could not have been required to suffer in attestation of his
opinion,&mdash;good as it was,&mdash;that the poets have done ill in
attributing the passions and the perturbations of human nature
to the immortal gods; nor Seneca, in behalf of those astronomical
and meteorological theories with which he entertains
himself and his friend Lucilius.</p>

<p>"When those who, after rejecting Christianity, talk of suffering
for the 'truth of God,' and speak as if they were conscience-bound
'toward God,' they must know that they not
only borrow a language which they are not entitled to avail
themselves of, but that they invade a ground of religious belief
whereon they can establish for themselves no right of
standing. They may indeed profess what <i>opinion</i> they please
as to the Divine attributes; but they cannot need to be told
that which the misgivings of their own hearts so often whisper
to them, that all such opinions are, at the very best, open to
debate, and must always be indeterminate, and that at this
time their own possession of the opinion which just now they
happen to cling to, is, in the last degree, precarious. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
then can martyrdom be transacted among those whose treading
is upon the fleecy clouds of undemonstrable religious feeling?"&mdash;pp.
92-94</p>

<p>If, being orthodox, you die at the stake, you are a martyr;
if, being heretic,&mdash;why, then you are a man burnt;&mdash;a
doctrine which Robert Hall compressed within the narrowest
compass, when he said, "It is the saint which makes the martyr,
not the martyr the saint." This is the very Gospel of
intolerance; and whoever preaches it may feel assured that
he can lend no help in any worthy "Restoration of Belief";
for he is himself infected with the most profound and penetrating
of scepticisms,&mdash;scepticisms of moral realities. The
rule, "that we may not lie to God, nor deny before men our
inward conviction in matters of religion," is, in our author's
view, the gift and glory of Christianity. Be it so. This rule
either holds for all men at all times, or it does <i>not</i>; if there
be persons who, notwithstanding it, <i>may</i> lie to God, and deny
their inward conviction, then the Scriptures, in communicating
it, have revealed no universal principle of duty, no obligation
having its seat in the nature of things and the constitution
of the human soul, but a mere sectional by-law, an arbitrary
precept for the security and good ordering of one
exclusive community. Then must we talk of it no more so
exceedingly proudly, as if it were a hidden truth revealed, a
latent beauty opened; it is no part of the holy legislation of
the universe, but a statutory enactment under which we fall,
or from which we escape, as we pass in or out at the door of
a certain historical belief. Need we say that this side of the
alternative strips Christianity of every pretension to be a
moral revelation at all? If, to take the other side, the rule
in question <i>does</i> hold for all men, then it is no less binding on
Mr. Newman and Mr. Greg than on our author; and in bowing
to its authority and owning its sanctity, they render a
homage as devoutly true as his, only different in this, that,
while they feel no disturbance from his kneeling in the sanctuary
at their side, he cannot be at peace till he has sprung to
his feet and hurled them from the place. They are guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
"plagiarism" forsooth! And in what? In knowing their duty,
without knowing where they learned it! O shame upon this
greediness, that would turn moral truth itself, and struggling
aspiration, into a property! As if Christ were one to stand
upon the copyright of revelation, and, unless his name were
in the title-page, would suffer neither thought nor prayer to
dedicate itself to God! Our author, as public prosecutor in
the Supreme Court, demands that the defendants shall empty
themselves out of every earnest sentiment, and surrender
back the words <span class="smcap">conscience</span>, and <span class="smcap">truth</span>, and <span class="smcap">righteousness</span>,
and <span class="smcap">sin</span>, and <span class="smcap">God</span>, "as <i>stolen</i> from the <span class="smcap">Book</span>"! What
then was "the Book" given for, but that it might freely furnish
these?&mdash;and how better can it fulfil its end, than by
opening for them a sacred welcome wherever the <i>things</i> are
which they disclose? Let their spirit breathe where it listeth;
it will not be less a Holy Spirit that we know not "whence it
cometh": nor let it be forgot how old a feature of evangelic
blessing it is, that "he that was healed <i>wist not who it was</i>."
As "the Book" does not, by its presence, <i>create</i> the facts
which it reveals, so neither does its absence or rejection <i>destroy</i>
them. Conscience, as an element of human nature, does not
come or go,&mdash;God, as reality in the universe, does not live
or perish,&mdash;according as the Bible is kept in the pocket or
laid upon the shelf; even if their first <i>witness</i> were in Scripture,
<i>they themselves</i> are in the world,&mdash;as active, as near, as
certain, in the transactions of to-day, as in the affairs of distant
history. Scientific truth, once well ascertained, can take
care of itself, without being everywhere attended by the report
of its first discovery; it is in the safe keeping of the
objects on which it writes a new meaning, and the phenomena
amid which it introduces a fresh symmetry. And moral
truth, when once embodied and revealed, is not less independent
of its earliest expression; it finds its response in human
consciousness, its reflection from human life, and weaves itself
up into the very fabric of many souls, whose pattern
bears no motto of its origin. Thus "revelation"&mdash;just in
proportion as it is revelation, and tells us what is cognate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
ourselves, and bound up with the realities around us&mdash;passes
of necessity into "natural religion"; and precisely according
to the measure in which it does so, will it acquire strength
and permanence, and dispense with evidence by merging into
self-evidence. Did it awaken in us <i>no</i> confirming experience,
did it <i>nowhere</i> link itself with the visible system of things,&mdash;then,
solving nothing, glorifying nothing, missed by all the
moving indices of nature and Providence, it would sit apart,
and become incredible. That could hardly be a truth at all,
which, after roaming the world and searching the soul for
eighteen centuries, has found no <i>natural</i> ground on which to
rest, and must wander as an <i>ipse dixit</i> still. And if natural
ground it has acquired, <i>that</i> is surely a proper basis for
its present support; it may innocently cease to be held on
mere authority; the very "plagiarism" so vehemently denounced
is rather the fulfilment than the destruction of the
faith, for it is only that men no longer resort to an oracle
for things which the oracle has enabled them to see for themselves.</p>

<p>Our Christian advocate, however, is not content with reserving
to his side the sole power of <i>discerning</i> the duty of
religious veracity; he further claims the sole right to <i>practise</i>
it. He teaches that it is <i>not binding</i> on all men at all times;
and that its obligation is in any case conditional on the "initial
postulate, that Christianity is from heaven." He thinks, apparently,
that the duty is not so much <i>revealed</i> as <i>constituted</i>
by the Gospel, so as to have no existence beyond the pale.
We can collect from his words two considerations, under
whose influence he seems to pronounce this strange judgment.
He evidently assumes that the duty of veracious profession is
contingent partly on the <i>object-matter</i> of belief; partly on the
<i>degree of evidence</i>. If my faith is directed towards <i>a Person</i>,
then, he implies, there is treachery, even blasphemy, in denying
it; but if not, my disclaimer gives no one any title to
complain, and I cannot be expected to die on behalf of a
proposition. Polycarp must not renounce Christ, his Lord;
but Plutarch might very properly recant, without at all altering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
his judgment against the poets, for ascribing passions to
the gods. Is it so, indeed? Then there is no harm in a lie,
unless some one is betrayed or insulted by it besides the hearers
whom we deceive,&mdash;and we may report as falsely as we
please our persuasion about <i>things</i>, provided we are true to
our sentiments about <i>persons</i>? With full recollection of the
questionable verdicts, on problems of veracity, which are given
by Xenophon and Plato, Aristotle and Cicero, we doubt whether
any Pagan moralist can be quoted in favor of a doctrine so
unworthy as this. The author seems to imagine that the
obligation to speak the truth is a mere duty of personal affection;
and that in the absence of this element, its claims altogether
disappear. Identifying falsehood with detraction and
ingratitude, he concludes that, since an abstract theory is insensible
to what people say about it, and can have no services
owing to it, it may be blamelessly repudiated by those who
really believe it. This is tantamount to an expunging of veracity
from the list of human duties altogether; for it gives
importance to what is purely accidental, and slights what is
alone essential to it. The conditions of a lie, in all its full-blown
wickedness, are quite complete, when there is a person
to speak it, a person to hear it, and a social state to be the
theatre of the deception; should there be also a person <i>spoken
of</i>, that is a circumstance in no way requisite to constitute the
guilt, but a supplementary condition, flinging in a new element
of pravity, and turning falsehood into faithlessness. The introduction
of this additional person into the case may doubtless
render the offence much more flagrant, especially if he
be one who has acknowledged claims on gratitude and reverence.
Calumny and perfidy are justly held in deeper abhorrence
than equivocation unstained with malignity. But to be
unaffected by the criminality till it kindles with this diabolical
glare, and not even to believe in it unless it smells sulphurous
and burns red, betrays a perception too much accustomed to
melodramatic contrasts of representation to appreciate the
more delicate tints and finer moral lights of the real and open
day. And so far from the glory of martyrdom being heightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
by the presence of deep personal affection as its inspiration,
this very circumstance renders the act a less arduous
sacrifice; just as to fall in the hot blood of battle may need
less heroism of will, than to die under the knife upon the surgeon's
table. In proportion as the denial of Christ in the
hour of trial would be the more intolerable blasphemy, must
the temptation to it be less overwhelming, and the merit of a
good confession less amazing. And those who, in matters
touching no such deep affection, can yet be true,&mdash;those who,
in simple clearness of conscience, can dispense, if need be,
with the help of enthusiasm, and so shut their lips against a
lie, that not the searing iron can open them,&mdash;those who do
not want a grand occasion, but just as certainly use the smallest,
to fling back the thing that is not,&mdash;have assuredly a
soul of higher prowess and more severely proved fidelity to
God. And it is a heartless thing to turn round upon these
men, and taunt them with having no one at whose feet to lay
their offering, and no popular sympathy to redeem their uprightness
from the imputation of conceit.</p>

<p>There is, however, another consideration which weighs with
our author in granting to "modern unbelievers" a dispensation
from the duty of religious veracity. They have only a
"personal persuasion" resting on precarious grounds, and not
the certitude attaching to "the conclusions of mathematical
and physical science"; and it would be folly to suffer on behalf
of "<i>undemonstrable</i> religious feeling"! Are we then to
lay it down as a canon in ethics, that intensity of assurance
is the measure of our obligation to speak the truth,&mdash;so that
we are to state our certainties correctly, but may tell lies
about our doubts? If so, scrupulous fidelity is incumbent on
us only within the limits of deductive science and of immediate
personal observation; and in the great sphere of <i>human</i>
affairs, in matters of historical, moral, and political judgment,
nay, in the incipient stage of all knowledge, we may say and
unsay, may play fast and loose with our convictions, according
as the favor or the fear of men hangs over us. Newton was
bound to stand by his "Principia"; but Locke might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
renounced his treatise on Government and taken his oath to
the divine rights of kings! Were he indeed to refuse so easy
a compliance, it would be a great reflection upon his modesty;
for if a man, on being threatened with death, will not belie
his own persuasion of probable truth, he is chargeable with
"overweening confidence in his own reasoning faculty"! It
is happy for the world that it does not always except the
morals of the Church, but brings an unperverted feeling to
correct the twisted logic of belief. "Opinion," a wise man
has said, "is but knowledge in the making"; and how little
knowledge would get made, if opinion were emptied of its
conscience, and looked on itself as an egotism rather than a
trust! If there is one fruit of intellectual culture which more
than another dignifies and ennobles it, it is the scrupulous reverence
it trains for the smallest reality, its watchfulness for
the earliest promise of truth, its tender care of every stamen
in the blossoming of thought, from whose flower-dust the seed
of a richer futurity may grow. To cut against this fine veracious
sense with the weapons of unappreciating sarcasm,
and crush its objects into the ground as weeds with the heel
of orthodox scorn, is a feat which can advance the step of
Christian evidence only by betraying the Christian ethics.
Our author has entangled himself in the metaphor indicated
by the word "<i>martyrdom</i>"; he thinks of the confessor as
<i>bearing witness</i> to something,&mdash;which is indeed quite true;
and supposes that the things to which he bears witness must
be <i>the facts or doctrines</i> held by him; and <i>this</i> is not true at
all. For that which we attest in the hour of persecution is
simply <i>our own state of mind; our belief</i>, and not the object
believed. We are required to utter words, or to perform
acts, that shall give report of our persuasion; this persuasion
is a fact in our personal psychology about which there is no
ambiguity; which, as a presence in our consciousness, is
wholly unaffected by the question how it got there, and by
what logical tenure it holds its seat. Whether we have demonstrated
it into the mind or fetched it thither in a dream,
whether we had it yesterday or shall continue to have it to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
are matters in no way altering the fact that it is
there; and if we say "No" to it, while conscious of a "Yes,"
the sin is neither greater when the belief concerns the properties
of a geometric solid, nor less when it touches some indeterminate
problem of metaphysics. The logical ground of
our judgments is various without end,&mdash;perception, testimony,
reasoning, in every possible combination. But the
persuasion, once attained, is a simple phenomenon, whose
affirmation, or denial, being always positively true, cannot
change its moral complexion with every shade in the evidence
now left behind. It is plain that, in our author's favorite case
of martyrdom, no testimony could be borne by the Christian
to anything but his own conviction. Polycarp and Cyprian
could only answer in the face of death, that they were Christians;
it was not "on behalf of" any outward fact, but simply
because they would not belie their inward belief, that they laid
down their lives. And had Plutarch been dragged before
some anthropomorphist inquisition, and been called on publicly
to declare his belief that the immortal gods were well
and truly painted by the poets as having passions like mankind,
the lie to which he was tempted would have been precisely
of the same kind; and had it passed his lips, would
have made him despicable as an apostate. He had no power,
nor had the Church confessor, over the truth or evidence of
his opinion; neither of them had any <i>witness</i>, in the strict
sense, to bear; but both might veraciously scorn to deny a
fact unambiguously present to their self-knowledge. If the
heathen's firmness is an example of "overweening confidence
in his own reasoning faculty," by what favoring difference
does the Christian's escape the same imputation? That his
faith is "absolute," his persuasion "irresistible," so far from
furnishing a vindication, only avows the fact that his "confidence"
is intense; whether it be "overweening" too, must
depend on the proportion between the certitude he feels and
the grounds of just assurance he possesses. But at all events
it is a confidence&mdash;in this case as in the other&mdash;undeniably
reposed "<i>in his own reasoning faculty</i>." How else could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
any belief&mdash;except a groundless belief&mdash;reach the convert's
mind at all? It is vain to pretend that the receivers of an
historic doctrine plant their reliance piously on God, while
its rejecters proudly trust themselves. There is no less subjective
action of the mind on the positive side than on the
negative; and on the soundness of that action does the worth
of the result in either instance depend. The evidence on
both sides comes into the same court of criticism; and pleading
and counter-pleading must ask a hearing from the same
judicial intelligence. If our author refers the Gospels to the
first century, and his opponents to the second; if he finds a
miracle in the gift of tongues, they a delusion; if he thinks
that the reasoning out of the Old Testament in the New is
exegetically and logically sound, they that it is in both respects
unsound;&mdash;is he not concerned with the same topics,
conducting the same processes, liable to the same mistaken
estimates, as they? How then can he flatter himself that
the same thing is believed on one tenure, and disbelieved on
quite another? How affect, even while playing the advocate,
to be raised above the contingencies of the "reasoning faculty,"
and entitled to rebuke its pride? How renounce it for
himself, appeal to it for your <i>as</i>sent, abuse it for your <i>dis</i>sent,
in the wayward course of two or three pages?</p>

<p>Our author stands, therefore, in spite of every effort to escape
it, on the same logical ground as his opponents; and
they, notwithstanding his objection to their companionship,
are on the same footing of religious obligation with himself.
He is offended to find such a one as Mr. Newman on the
same sacred pavement, and to overhear from unbelieving lips
the genuine tones of prayer; and, thanking God, apprises
men that he "is not as this publican." He prosecutes for
trespass all who, after rejecting his Christianity, can dare to
profess allegiance to the "truth of God," and "speak <i>as if
they were conscience-bound towards God</i>." Are they then
<i>not</i> so bound? Has no one a conscience except the approved
historical believer? Is it not in others also a Divine voice,&mdash;a
Holy Spirit,&mdash;which to resist and stifle were the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
and only "Infidelity"? Surely the faith in God, and the
earnest acceptance of the laws of duty as the expression of
his authority, are not forbidden to men who cannot assume
the disciple's style. These sentiments, so far from waiting
on revelation for their possibility, are the pre-requisite conditions
of all revelation, the state of mind to which it speaks,
the secret power by which it finds us out; and if men cannot
be "conscience-bound towards God" <i>before and without</i> Christianity,
never can they become so <i>after it and with it</i>. It
does not take us up as atheists and brutes, and supply us
with the faculties as well as the substance of faith; else were
there no medium of suasion across the boundary of unbelief;&mdash;but
it appeals to us as knowing much and aspiring to
more,&mdash;as already before the face, only shrinking from the
clear look of God,&mdash;as feeling the divine restraint upon us
of justice, purity, and truth, but unable, without some emancipating
power, to turn it into freedom and joy. This spirit
of profound sympathy, not of arrogant insult, towards the
highest faiths and affections of our nature, we recognize in
the portraiture and teachings of Jesus Christ; and when we
find one who, like our author, instead of rejoicing that the
sacred embers of nature are yet warm, instead of kneeling
over them to fan them with a breath of reverence into a
flame, flings them with scattering scorn on the damp ground
of his own moral scepticism to show how little they will burn,&mdash;we
see reversed in the "Restorer of Belief" the divine
temper of the "Author of Faith." Such a teacher will vainly
endeavor to recover by severity of warning the influence
he forfeits by want of sympathy. He cannot frighten men
like Parker, Newman, Greg, by appealing to fancied "misgivings
of their own hearts" respecting the precariousness of
their convictions, and uttering dismal prophecies about yawning
gulfs; which, however alarming as a shudder of rhetoric,
can disturb no quiet trust in reality. Let us hear the words,
however:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Educated men should not wait to be reminded that those
who, after abandoning a peremptory historic belief, endeavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
to retain Faith and Piety for their comfort, stand upon a slope
that has no ledges: Atheism in its simplest form yawns to
receive those who there stand; and they know themselves to
be gravitating towards it.</p>

<p>"It would be far more reasonable for a man to die as a
martyr for Atheism,&mdash;a stage beyond which no further progress
is possible,&mdash;than to do so at any point short of that
terminus, knowing as he does that every day is bringing him
nearer to the gulf. The stronger the mind is, and the more
it has of intellectual massiveness, the more rapid will be its
descent upon this declivity. Minds of little density, and of
much airy sentiment, may stay long where they are, just as
gnats and flies walk to and fro upon the honeyed sides of a
china vase; they do not go down, but never again will they
fly."&mdash;p. 94.</p>

<p>This is one of the conventional minatory arguments which
betray the absence of security and repose from the heart of
the received theology; whose teachers could never propound
it, except from a position of conscious danger. They must
imagine in their own case that, if they were to find the Gospels
no longer oracular, they would plunge at once into endless
depths of negation; and that, unless they can refute an
interpretation of De Wette's, or correct a date of Baur's, there
will be eternal night in heaven. They feel the universe, and
life, and love, and sorrow, and the history of times and races
unbaptized, to be all atheistic through and through,&mdash;profane
to the core,&mdash;untraced by a vestige, untransfigured by a
color, of divine significance. What they can think of a Being
who creates all reality and lives in it on these blindfold terms,
we will not attempt to decide; but it is no wonder that, having
once brought themselves to believe in Him, they feel how
a single move would overset them into disbelief. This thing,
however, is true of their own state of mind alone; whose
spaces, dark throughout with scepticism but for one distant
lamp, might easily be left without a ray. It is consistent
neither with reason nor with experience to threaten with
this rule men who have opened their souls to something else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
than documentary authority. It is notoriously false that
the career of historic doubt usually terminates in the loss of
all faith in God; nor do we suppose that our author would
have awarded to the atheist, for actually reaching this point,
the praise of "intellectual massiveness," had he not wanted a
heavy weight to slide down his metaphorical inclined plane,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and outstrip the slippery believers who try to stop half-way.
The accusation against Theism, of being possible to the
light-minded and superficial,&mdash;a mere sweet-bait to entrap
the silly insects of the intellectual world,&mdash;is confuted by the
whole history of philosophy and human culture; all whose
grandest names have connected themselves with the recognition
of a religion indigenous or accessible to the faculties of
the soul. Let our author collect on one side of his library
all the giants and heroes of utter disbelief, and on the other
the literature of natural faith; nay, let him ransack for fresh
names and forgotten suffrages Lalande's "Dictionnaire des
Athées"; and if, having weighed the various merits of Leucippus
and Lucretius, of Baron d'Holbach and La Mettrie,
of Robert Owen and Atkinson, he thinks them of more sterling
mass than the pure gold of thought and life accumulated
by Socrates, Plato, Antoninus,&mdash;by Anselm and Abelard,
Descartes and Arnaud,&mdash;by the authors of the "Theodicée,"
the "Essay on the Human Understanding," and the "Principles
of Human Knowledge,"&mdash;by Kant and Cousin,&mdash;by
Butler and Paley and Arnold,&mdash;we can only profess a dissent
from his intellectual taste, not less than from his moral
judgment.</p>

<p>The few pages on which we have been commenting were
the first&mdash;though they are near the end of the treatise&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
fully opened our eyes to the author's theological <i>animus</i>.
For a while, his large professions, and, no doubt, sincere purpose
of fairness,&mdash;his apparent breadth of view, and his free
hand in putting down his subject on the canvas,&mdash;secured our
admiring confidence, and made us feel that here at length
justice, earnestness, and accomplishment will go together.
One feature, indeed, we noticed as giving a suspicious appearance
to his equity of temper; it displays itself more in censoriousness
towards his friends, than in large-heartedness
towards his antagonists. He readily allows faults in the advocates
of his own side, but is never carried away into even
a momentary appreciation of the other. This particular form
of impartiality, which consists in detracting from the merits
of allies, instead of delighting in those of opponents, is the
ecclesiastic counterfeit of candor,&mdash;the half-shekel, which is
alone payable in the temple-service, but which nowhere, save
at the sacred money-table, is deemed equivalent to the good
Roman coin of common life. Much as we dislike the chink
of this consecrated metal, we hoped that it would only ring
for a passing instant on the ear. But alas! it is an indication
seldom deceptive; and we feel constrained to report that
there are, in this tract, quotations from both Mr. Newman
and Mr. Greg, which, if we were in the court of veracity, and
not of theology, we would say are unconscientiously made.
The quotations are made anonymously as well as unfaithfully,
so that the reader, unless haunted by the checking impressions
of memory, cannot correct the injustice of the writer.
The "Phases of Faith" describes, it will be remembered, the
gradual course of Mr. Newman's defections from his original
orthodoxy. His first movements of doubt were naturally
timid and inconsiderable, bringing him only to the conclusion,
that the genealogy in the first chapter of Matthew was copied
wrong, and counted wrong, from the Old Testament. On
this step followed a second, and a third, each more important
than the preceding, and necessitating a next more momentous
than itself. The latter stages of his progress included an inquiry
into the evidence of the Resurrection, the miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
gifts ascribed to the early Church, the claims to credit of the
Apostle Paul, and other topics, undeniably affecting the very
essence of Christian evidence. Having traced the successive
advances of his doubts, Mr. Newman, in a recapitulary "Conclusion,"
makes a solemn appeal to his readers, to say at what
point he could have stopped, and to lay a finger distinctly on
the place at which the guilt of his scepticism began. One by
one he counts out the steps by which he had proceeded, and
asks, "Was this the sinful one?" The whole effect of the
appeal is certainly an impression that the series, if not an inevitable
sequence, is very difficult to break; and that, small
as the beginnings were, they linked themselves, by close connection,
with very momentous results. From this chapter
our author cites a sentence or two, but in such a way as immediately
to conjoin the small initial steps of doubt with the
great ultimate conclusion, and to make it appear that Mr.
Newman renounced Christianity because he could not make
out the pedigree of Jesus to his satisfaction. The genealogical
difficulty is the only one which he quotes, and as to which
Mr. Newman is permitted to speak for himself. Presenting
this as a specimen, and suppressing all the rest, he says that he
could have shown "this writer" a course far better "than, on
account of difficulties <i>such as these</i>, to renounce Christianity"!
His citation from Mr. Greg is introduced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let another witness be heard; and in hearing him one
might think that his words are an echo that has come softly
travelling down, through sixteen centuries, from some field of
blood, or some forum, or some amphitheatre, where Christian
men were witnessing a good confession in the midst of their
mortal agonies! <i>This</i> witness is one who assures us that 'he
can believe no longer, he can worship no longer; he has discovered
that the creed of his early days is baseless, or fallacious.'
Yet he too takes up the <span class="smcap">Martyr Truth</span>, that we
must not lie to God."&mdash;p. 91.</p>

<p>Here, then, Mr. Greg (with concealment of his name) is
represented as one who, by his own confession, <i>can neither believe
nor worship any more</i>. Turning to the preface of "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
Creed of Christendom," we find the following original to this
quotation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The pursuit of truth is easy to a man who has no human
sympathies, whose vision is impaired by no fond partialities,
whose heart is torn by no divided allegiance. To him the renunciation
of error presents few difficulties; for the moment
it is recognized as error, its charm ceases. But the case is
very different with the Searcher whose affections are strong,
whose associations are quick, whose hold upon the Past is
clinging and tenacious. He may love Truth with an earnest
and paramount devotion; but he loves much else also. He
loves errors, which were once the cherished convictions of his
soul. He loves dogmas which were once full of strength and
beauty to his thoughts, though now perceived to be baseless or
fallacious. He loves the Church where he worshipped in his
happy childhood; where his friends and his family worship
still; where his gray-haired parents await the resurrection of
the Just; but where <i>he</i> can worship and await no more. He
loves the simple old creed, which was the creed of his earlier
and brighter days; which is the creed of his wife and children
still; but which inquiry has compelled him to abandon. The
past and the familiar have chains and talismans which hold
him back in his career, till every fresh step forward becomes
an effort and an agony; every fresh error discovered is a
fresh bond snapped asunder; every new glimpse of light is
like a fresh flood of pain poured in upon the soul. To such
a man the pursuit of Truth is a daily martyrdom,&mdash;how hard
and bitter let the martyr tell. Shame to those who make it
doubly so; honor to those who encounter it saddened, weeping,
trembling, but unflinching still."&mdash;p. xvi.</p>

<p>Our author would snatch from Mr. Greg the right to say,
we must not lie to God. Which has the better right to say,
"Thou shalt not lie to men"?</p>

<p>The more ingenuously the modern Orthodoxy lays bare its
essence, the more evident is it that a profound scepticism not
only mingles with it, but constitutes its very inspiration. The
dread of losing God, the impression that there is but one patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
way, not of duty, but of thought, of meeting him, haunt
the minds of men, driving some to Anglicanism to compensate
defect of faith by excess of sacrament, some to Rome in
quest of the Lord's body, and prompting others to conservative
efforts of Bibliolatry, conducted with ever-decreasing
reason and declining hope. We have seen, however, no such
exemplification of this radical distrust as in the treatise before
us. Already has the writer declared that the moral side of
the universe sends in, with regard to religion, an empty report.
And now he hastens to tell us that, on the physical side,
the watchmen from every observatory of nature cry out, "No
God." He represents the natural sciences as a huge Titanic,
resistless mass of knowledge, perfectly demonstrable, and
completely irreligious; descending, like a glacier, from the
upper valleys of frozen thought; sure to scrape away the
wild pine woods and the green fields of natural religion, yet
considerate enough, for some reason unexplained, to spare the
foundations of the village church. Designating every faith
except his own by such phrases as "theosophic fancies," and
"pietistic notions," he assures us that they will all be put
"right out of existence" by "our modern physical sciences";
and he borrows from the "Positive Philosophy" (apparently
by unconscious sympathy) the following maxim to justify his
prediction:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In any case, when that which on any ground of proof takes
full hold of the understanding, (such, for example, are the most
certain of the conclusions of Geology,) stands contiguous to
that which, in a logical sense, is of inferior quality, and is indeterminate,
and fluctuating, and liable to retrogression,&mdash;in
any such case there is always going on a silent encroachment
of the more solid mass upon the ground of that which is less
solid. What is <span class="smcap">sure</span> will be pressing upon what is uncertain,
whether or not the two are designedly brought into collision
or comparison. What is well defined weighs upon, and
against, what is ill defined. Nothing stops the continuous involuntary
operation of <span class="smcap">Science</span> in dislodging <span class="smcap">Opinion</span> from
the minds of those who are conversant with both.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very small matter that is indeed determinate, will be
able to keep a place for itself against this incessantly encroaching
movement; but nothing else can do so. As to any
of those theosophic fancies which we may wish to cling to,
after we have thrown away the Bible, we might as well suppose
that they will resist the impact of the mathematical and
physical sciences, as imagine that the lichens of an Alpine
gorge will stay the slow descent of a glacier."&mdash;p. 97.</p>

<p>Here it is alleged that Science and Opinion cannot coexist,&mdash;that
the demonstrable will banish the probable. And be it
observed, this is to take place, not simply where contradiction
arises between the two orders of belief, but in <i>all cases</i>, from
the mere <i>distaste</i> which quantitative studies produce towards
everything which evades their rules. In this allegation there
is, we believe, with much exaggeration, a certain small amount
of truth,&mdash;a truth, however, which, so far from supporting
our author's plea against natural religion, offers it a conclusive
refutation. It may be admitted that the exact and mixed sciences
<i>do</i> disincline their votary to put trust in the processes
by which judgments of probability are formed, and alienate
him from thinkers who read off the meaning of the universe
by another key than his. Accustomed to deal with Number
and Space, with Motion and Force alone,&mdash;to reason upon
them by a Calculus which is helpless beyond their range,&mdash;to
exercise Faculties involving nothing beyond the interpretation
of mensurative signs and the conception of relative magnitudes,&mdash;he
owes it to something else than his peculiar discipline,
if he has either the instruments or the aptitudes for
moral and philosophical reflection. He carries into the world,
as his sole means of representing and solving its phenomena,
the notion of physical necessity and linear sequence, secretly
defining the universe to himself as Leibnitz defined an organized
being,&mdash;"a machine, whose smallest parts are also machines,"&mdash;and
naturally grows impatient when he finds himself
in fields of thought over which this narrow imagination
opens no track. With respect, therefore, to a certain class of
minds, rendered perhaps increasingly numerous by the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
neglect of the moral sciences in England, it may be quite true,
that a spirit of utter disbelief towards everything beyond the
range of necessary matter may more and more prevail. Let
us further grant to our author, for the moment, three things
assumed by him, all of them, however, false:&mdash;1. That this
tendency of the "demonstrable sciences" is their <i>only</i> one
having a bearing on "theosophic systems." 2. That it is so
<i>new</i>, at least in degree, as to give "opinion" a worse chance
for the future than it has had in the past. 3. That it is a <i>good</i>
tendency, favorable to human knowledge and character. Still
we must ask, How is the <i>oracular authority of the Bible</i> to
escape the fate predicted for all probabilities? Our author
assures us that it <i>will</i> escape; but he gives no faintest hint of
a reason for so singular an exception to his own canon. It
cannot be contended that the evidences of Christianity and
Judaism belong to any of the "demonstrable" or "physical"
sciences. It cannot be denied that they lie wholly within the
limits of contingent knowledge, and terminate only in "probabilities";
that the authorship, for instance, of the fourth Gospel,
the credibility of the introductory chapters of Matthew,
the correctness of the prophecies about the second advent, are
matters which, "standing contiguous" to the laws of refracted
and reflected light, occupy the position of the <i>less sure</i> in relation
to the <i>more sure</i>; that the <i>relative</i> chronology of the
Scripture books is more indeterminate than that of the geologic
strata, and their <i>actual</i> dates more uncertain than those
of the eclipses fatal to Nicias and to Perseus. What, then, is
to exempt these judgments of verisimilitude from being pushed
"right out of existence" by the "silent encroachment of the
more solid mass" of knowledge beside it? Nothing can be
plainer than that all testimonial knowledge whatsoever, all
history, criticism, and art, the whole system of moral and
political sciences, must fall under our author's fatal sentence;
and how the propositions which sustain the infallible authority
of the canonical books are to hold their ground against the
huge glacier on which Herschel, Airy and De Morgan, Comte
and Leverrier, triumphantly ride, it is not easy to conceive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
Amid the universal crash of probabilities, may not the Mosaic
tables of stone, broken once, be pulverized at last? With the
abrasion of all the alluvial soil in which the growths of wonder
strike their roots, will the garden of Eden, will the
blighted fig-tree, remain to mark a verdant and a barren spot
in history? Will these riding philosophers from their cold
observatory find Paul's "third heaven"? May not their icy
mountain slip into "the abyss" whence all the demons came,
and fill it up? These questions, indeed, are answered for us
in experience. It is notorious that, whenever an unbounded
devotion to science has produced a prevalent tendency to disbelief,
Revelation, so far from being spared, has been usually
the first object of attack; and, both at the origin of modern
science in the sixteenth century, and during its accelerated
advance towards the close of the eighteenth, the widening
conception of determinate Law was found to threaten nothing
so decisively as the faith in supernatural dispensations. The
greater scepticism includes the less; and the habit of mind
which lets slip all beliefs not legitimated by the canons of natural
science, cannot possibly retain Christianity.</p>

<p>But our author has only <i>half</i> described the mental effect of
studies purely scientific. They do not, in the nature of things
they <i>cannot</i>, simply push out of the mind all contingent judgments.
Human life and action are one continuous texture of
such judgments, with some interweaving, no doubt, of mathematic
forms, which could not be picked out without spoiling
the symmetry of its pattern; but were you to withdraw the
threads of probable opinion, still more, to cut the warp of primitive
assumptions that stretches through it, the web would simply
fall to pieces. No youth can decide on a profession, no
man appoint an agent in his business, no physician prescribe
for a patient, no judge pronounce a sentence, no statesman answer
a despatch, without a constant resort to "surmises," a
reliance on slender indications, often even a deliberate adoption
of very doubtful hypotheses. All men are driven from
hour to hour into positions demanding combinations of thought
which can be borrowed from no natural science; where not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the laws of matter and motion, not the equilibrium of forces,
not the properties of things, are chiefly concerned, but the
feelings and faculties of persons, the action and reaction of
human affairs. Mathematicians and natural philosophers, being
in no way exempt from these conditions, are obliged to
have just as many "opinions" and "guesses" as other men;
they cannot, if they are to keep their footing on this world at
all, have a smaller stock than their neighbors of this "logically
inferior" order of persuasions. They are unable to abdicate
the necessity of having these persuasions; and their only peculiarity
is, that they sometimes import into contingent affairs
the methods with which habit has rendered them familiar in
another sphere, and so find the conditions of belief unsatisfied;
and at others, from consciousness that their own clew will not
serve, yet inaptitude for seizing a better, surrender themselves
to the fortuitous guidance of ill-balanced faculties and external
solicitations. Hence their judgments are frequently fantastic,
frequently sceptical,&mdash;not less liable to be too easy from
one cause than to be too reluctant from another; and were a
history to be written of the most remarkable extravagances,
positive as well as negative, by which religion and philosophy
have sprung aside from the centre of common sense and feeling,
it would contain more names of great repute in the exact
sciences than from any other intellectual class whatever. From
Pythagoras to Swedenborg, the eccentricities of mathematical
and physical imagination have been the chief disturbers of a
natural and healthy faith. Harmonic theories of the universe,
Ideal Numbers, Geometric Ethics, Rosicrucian fraternities,
Vortices and Monads, Apocalyptic studies, New Jerusalems,
and Electrobiological Metaphysics, have all borne testimony to
the aberrant fancy of eminent proficients in the sciences. It
is, therefore, far from being universally true, that disputable
theosophies and conjectural systems of the universe are distasteful
to minds schooled in the "demonstrable sciences." If
to men of this order we owe the successive dislodgement of one
such hypothesis after another, to them also do we owe their
continual reproduction. Whether the unsoundness of judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
which is contracted in the absence of historical, moral,
and metaphysical studies shall show itself in an excessive
slowness or an excessive facility of belief, will depend on accidents
of personal character and social position. But of this
we may be sure;&mdash;if the <i>sceptical</i> temper be the direction
taken, the Bible will not be spared; if the <i>credulous</i>, "theosophic
fancies" will be copiously saved.</p>

<p>Can there, after all, be a more paradoxical spectacle than
that of a religious writer allying himself with the sceptical
propensities of science, in order to get rid of gainsayers of
the Bible? It is the counterpart in logic of the Italian game
in politics,&mdash;the Pope appealing to Parisian swords to drive
out the Republic, and save the head of Christendom. Is it
possible that our author can <i>approve</i> the agency which he thus
invokes? that he can really wish to see it in the intellectual
ascendant, and garrisoning every sacred fortress of the world?
Does he remember what are the fundamental canons of its
logic,&mdash;that we know nothing but Phenomena,&mdash;that Causation
is nothing but phenomenal priority,&mdash;or else, that Force
is the prior datum of which Thought is a particular and posterior
development? And what, on the other hand, are the
"theosophic fancies" against which he would plant this barbaric
artillery of Fate? They are such as these,&mdash;that our
faculties give us trustworthy reports, not of phenomena only,
but of their abiding ground,&mdash;Soul within, God without;&mdash;that
the moral Law of Obligation in the one is the expression
of Holy Will in the other;&mdash;that faithfulness in the Human
mind to its highest aspirations, brings it into communion with
the Divine;&mdash;that as the Soul is the free Image, so is Nature
the determinate Handiwork of God. If these doctrines,
spurned by our author with so rude a flippancy, <i>were</i> to surrender
to the hostility on which he relies, is he unaware of the
character the conflict would assume, and of the dynasty of
thought which would reign undisputed at the close? Fighting
by the side of such allies against "theosophic fancies," <i>he</i>
may skirmish with the "fancies," but <i>they</i> will bear right down
upon the "Theism" in the centre; and when the day is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
the standard they will plant upon the conquered towers will
be, not the sacred dove he took into the field, and lost to the
defeated foe, but their own blind black eagle of necessity.
How strange is the perversion of instinctive sympathies, when
a theologian disparages the sciences of reflection and self-knowledge,
and takes his stand on the evidence of sense and
measurement alone!&mdash;when he proposes to sweep out beliefs
that trouble him with their neighborhood, by a general crusade
against all probabilities,&mdash;and when, with this design, he violates
the just balance of power among the kingdoms of human
knowledge, and flatters, as if it were a virtue, the pretensions
of a mental habit, which, out of its own province, is one of
the most incapacitating, yet destructive, of intellectual vices!
There is, however, a certain secret affinity of feeling between
a Religion which exaggerates the functions and overstrains
the validity of an external authority, and a Science which
deals only with objective facts, perceived or imagined. The
point of sympathy is found in a common distrust of everything
internal, even of the very faculties (as soon as they are
contemplated as such) by which the external is apprehended
and received. And between this sort of faith and the mathematics
there is another analogy, which may explain so curious
a mutual understanding. Both rest upon <i>hypotheses</i>,
which it is beyond their province to look into, but after the assumption
of which, all room for opinion is shut out by a rigid
necessity. <i>Once get</i> your infallible book, and (supposing the
meaning unambiguous) it settles every matter on which it pronounces;
and once allow the first principles and definitions in
geometry to express truths and realities, and you can deny
nothing afterwards. It is the business of philosophy to go <i>below</i>
the mathematics, and determine whether they are <i>more
than hypothetical</i> science,&mdash;whether their assumptions are a
mere play of subjective necessity, or are objectively trustworthy.
It is the business of both reflective philosophy and
historical criticism to go below "the <span class="smcap">book</span>," and determine
whether it has <i>more than hypothetical</i> infallibility,&mdash;whether
the conditions, inner and outer, of such a claim, are or are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
satisfied. If even the Mathematics, which have little to fear
from the investigation of their basis, have not been on the
best terms with Metaphysics, it is hardly surprising that a
Religion of mere external authority should feel antipathy for
the studies which pry into its foundations, with the inevitable
effect of showing that what is <i>certainty</i> above ground is <i>opinion</i>
below. Nor is it wonderful that both sets of beliefs are fond
of forgetting their hypothetical origin, contemplating only
their acquired semblance of security, and speaking as if they
disowned contingency altogether, and despised the detractors
who could suspect such a taint in their blood. Hence the fellow-feeling
which occasionally unites a rigid theology, and an
exclusive physical and mathematical science. It is founded
on their joint antipathy to the sources of <i>moral</i> knowledge,&mdash;their
common blindness to one half of human culture. Like
all alliances resting on antipathy alone, it is neither honorable
nor durable. It is the function of Religion to occupy a tranquil
seat above the contests of partial pursuits and narrow interests;
as, in the world of action, to hold the balance of
Right, so, in the world of intellect, to preserve the equities and
the equilibrium of Truth; and her trust is betrayed by any
one who flings himself, as her representative, into the civil
wars of the sciences, and in her name signs away whole provinces
of thought, and abandons them to outrage and confiscation
as conquered lands. Human faith has nothing to fear
from the unity and perfection of all the sciences; but much
from the blind ambition of each one. It is from this persuasion
alone, and not from any defective appreciation of physical
studies, that we have spoken freely of their tendency, when
the mind is entirely enclosed within them. The undoubted
source of inestimable blessings to mankind, and an indispensable
element of culture to the individual, they are mischievous
only when they grow dizzy with success, and propound
schemes of universal empire. The moment they undertake
either to create or destroy a religion, the sign is unmistakable
that this intoxicated ambition has begun to work.</p>

<p>The relation of Religion to History our author appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
us to conceive much more correctly than its relation to Science.
On this great topic, however, our limits forbid us to enter.
One remark only we will make. The author misconceives
the objection of Theodore Parker and others to the ordinary
doctrine of historical revelation. They do not, as he affirms,
"disjoin religion from history," or in the least decline the
"travelling back to ages past" on its account. It is not the
<i>presence</i> of God in antiquity, but his presence <i>only</i> there,&mdash;not
his inspiration in Palestine, but his withdrawal from every
spot besides,&mdash;not even his supreme and unique expression
in Jesus of Nazareth, but his absence from every other human
medium,&mdash;against which these writers protest. They feel
that the usual Christian advocate has adopted a narrow and
even irreligious ground; that he has not found a satisfactory
place in the Divine scheme of human affairs for the great
Pagan world; that he has presumptuously branded all history
but one as "profane"; that he has not only read it without
sympathy and reverence, but has used it chiefly as a foil to
show off the beauty of evangelic truth and holiness, and so
has dwelt only on the inadequacy of its philosophy, the deformities
of its morals, the degenerate features of its social life;
that he has forgotten the Divine infinitude when he assumes
that Christ's plenitude of the Spirit implies the emptiness of
Socrates. In their view, he has rashly undertaken to prove,
not <i>one positive</i> fact,&mdash;a revelation of divine truth in Galilee,&mdash;but
an <i>infinite negative</i>,&mdash;no inspiration anywhere else. To
this <i>negation</i>, and to this alone, is their remonstrance addressed.
They do not deny a <i>theophany</i> in the gift of Christianity; but
they deny two very different things, viz.:&mdash;1. That this is the
<i>only</i> theophany; and, 2. That this is theophany <i>alone</i>;&mdash;that
is, they look for <i>some</i> divine elements elsewhere; and they look
for <i>some</i> human here. It is not therefore a smaller, but a
larger, religious obligation to history, which they are anxious
to establish; and they remain in company with the Christian
advocate, so long as his devout and gentle mood continues;
and only quit him when he enters on his sceptical antipathies.
This, in spite of every resistance from the rigor of the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
theology, is an inevitable consequence of the modern historical
criticism. Its large and genial apprehension opens for us
new admirations, new sympathies, clearer insight into human
realities, throughout the nations and ages of the past. It
melts away from our ancient moral geography the ideal contrasts
of coloring which made the world the scene of an unnatural
dualism, and reinstates the great families of man in
unity. It is doing for our conception of the moral world what
science has already done for our conception of the natural: it
is expanding our notion of Divine agency within it. As, in
reference to physical nature, we have learned to think that
God did not enact creation but once, and cease; so are we beginning
to perceive, in relation to the human mind and life, that
he did not enter history only once, and quite exceptionally.
Whoever opens his heart to this great thought will find in it,
not the uneasiness of doubt, but the repose of faith. He will
no longer fancy that, in order to keep Christianity as the
divinest of all, he must fear to feel aught else divine. He
will worship still at the same altar, and sing his hymn to the
same strain; only with a richer chorus of consentient voices,
and in a wider communion of faithful souls.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ONE_GOSPEL_IN_MANY_DIALECTS" id="ONE_GOSPEL_IN_MANY_DIALECTS">ONE GOSPEL IN MANY DIALECTS.</a></h2>

<blockquote class="matchind"><p>"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other
tongues, according as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were sojourning
at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together; and
they were confounded because every one heard them speaking in his own
language."&mdash;Acts ii. 4-6.</p></blockquote>


<p>In that marvellous scene, the anniversary of which coincides
on this Whitsunday with our Centenary, a question long
pending between the Rabbis and the Holy Spirit came to an
open issue. They were Aramæan scholars, and had their
Kingdom of Heaven set forth in the best Hebrew, which, true
enough, was of no great human currency, and not strictly a
living tongue at all; but then had been distinguished by
Divine use from the earliest time. Was it not in this that the
Call had come to Abram? and the promises been repeated to
the Patriarchs? and the music been flung from the harp of
David? and the burdens of inspiration been treasured on the
Prophet's scroll? Who could quote a word that God had
ever spoken in any other language? It was the one sacred
idiom, from which all others are divergent corruptions, and
to which, when the world's confusion is over, they must again
return. However few in these decadent ages might understand
it still, it was intrinsically fitted to be universal. And
who could call <i>that</i> speech provincial, at whose sound the
heavens and earth arose? or esteem it temporary, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
persevered through the dispersion at Babel, and was present
on the world before the Flood? So there must be nothing
else allowed in the liturgies of the Synagogue, in the reading
of Scripture, or in any intercourse between <i>man and God</i>.
Only when men began to converse <i>with one another</i>, to compare
their human thoughts, and descend from prophetic to didactic
gifts, might they resort to the media of profaner life.
The language of Worship was but one; though the jargons of
Opinion were many. And so the Scribes and the Rabbis of
the written Word supposed themselves to hold the only key
of life.</p>

<p>But the Holy Spirit goes into no one's keeping, and is no
respecter of tongues. Free as the wind to blow where it listeth,
it sweeps wherever souls are genial to its breath, and will
yield to it their gifts, of love, of lips, of life. It seemed to
have had enough of Hebrew, ever since it had gone into the
hands of the philologists, and been made a sacred language,
and begun to drone. It had long been feeling its way in other
directions, tempting men to pray out of the fresh heart, and
never mind the words, till now at last the secret broke, that
on any native tongue by which souls most freely flow together,
may all pass out to God; that the home-sounds are the devoutest
too; that the speech into which men are born, and
which has become to them as a stringed instrument answering
to the faintest touch of their affections, is the true vehicle by
which "the Spirit giveth utterance." The prayer of faith,
ascending in the idioms of every latitude, converges into one
in heaven. And God's truth, descending to this world, breaks
into all the moulds of expression native to our various race.</p>

<p><i>One Gospel in many dialects</i>,&mdash;that is the great Pentecost
lesson, construe the miracle as we may. And there are dialects
of <i>Thought</i> as well as speech,&mdash;natural differences of
temperament and character,&mdash;to which the Gospel, still without
prejudice to its unity, adapts itself with the same divine
flexibility. What private observer&mdash;still more what student
of history&mdash;can doubt that we are not all made in the same
mould,&mdash;that the proportions of our humanity are variously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
mixed,&mdash;that not only do we individually differ in moral susceptibility
and spiritual depth, but fall into permanent groups
marked by distinct and ineradicable characters, and reproducing
the same religious tendencies from age to age? Transpose
the souls of Plato and Pascal into the right place and
time, and do you suppose they would turn up as <i>Latitudinarian
Divines</i>? Deal as you will with the lot of Priestley and
Belsham, and could you ever enroll them among the <i>Christian
Mystics</i>? Close in the fires of Augustine's nature with
what damps you may, and could you ever find him peace in a
Gospel of <i>Good Works</i>? No; we touch here on differences
deeper than accident, and irremovable by culture,&mdash;differences
that vindicate their reality by crossing the lines of dissimilar
religions and reappearing in all times. They necessarily
give us differing wants and experiences; they set into differing
shapes of faith; and on souls equally faithful they fix very
differing expressions. They are so many <i>vernacular idioms
of the inner mind</i>: all have divine right to be: no one of
them is entitled to call itself the sacred language alone intelligible
between man and God; and the pretension of any to
supersede the rest, and reign alone, is not less vain than the
complaints of ignorance against foreign dialects, and the ambition
to exchange the many running waters of local literature
into the huge tank of a universal language. They may not
be able to understand each other, or even with the key of
outward comparison always bear translation into idioms other
than their own. But let them speak in their own way, and
pray their own prayer. Not only are they all clear to Him
that readeth the heart; there will thus be <i>more heart for Him
to read</i>: for faith and love, large as they may be, are ever
deepest in their special tones; and the prayer, the hymn,
which is touched with the spirit's local coloring, comes to us
like the aroma of native fields, and assuages our thirst like
the sweet waters of some well given to our fathers and made
sacred by a Saviour's noonday rest.</p>

<p>On this principle,&mdash;that different types of natural genius
in men cannot but throw their Christianity into different forms,&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
may not only justify the divisions of Christendom, but
even cease to wish that they should disappear. Unity no
doubt there must be: God is one; Truth is one; the Gospel
is one; and a mind that could take in the whole, and spread
its insight and affections in all dimensions at once, would reach
the Divine equilibrium, in which nothing partial preponderates.
But from our watch-tower we can look through only one window
at once; the blind walls of our mental chamber shut out
all the rest; and as we kneel, like Daniel, at the open light,
the breeze upon our face seems sacred, because it comes from
our Jerusalem. The question is not, whether there is such a
thing as truth, rounded off, self-balanced, and complete; in the
mind of God,&mdash;the final seat of reality,&mdash;of course there is.
Nor is it a question, whether each individual man can attain
a faith consistent in its parts, agreeable to fact, and adequate
to his nature. This also is possible. But when he has attained
it, on what terms is it to co-exist with other faiths presenting
parallel pretensions? Is he in his heart to identify
his own with the absolute truth, sufficient for <i>all</i> as for himself?
Is he to expect them to come round to it, and altogether
throw away their own? Or is he to confess to himself his
own limitations, to suspect that he may have his blind sides,
and reverently to seek something he has missed in that which
others persist in seeing? In which direction is he to seek
unity? By antipathy to all beliefs save one?&mdash;or by inviting
all of them to live their life and show their place in human
nature? It is the genius of Romanism to seek unity by <i>suppression</i>;
of Protestantism, by free <i>development</i>;&mdash;of the former,
to protect the consistency it has; of the latter, to press forward
to one that it has not. Are we taunted with our "Protestant
variations"? Why, the more they are, the richer is
our field of experience, the finer our points of comparison;
provided, however, that we hold fast to the noble trust in a
Gospel of identity at bottom, and seek it rather in the religious
heart of all the churches, than in the theologic wisdom of
our own. No man can proclaim the principle of "<i>One Gospel
in many dialects</i>," unless he is prepared to admit that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
own faith is <i>one of the dialects, and nothing more</i>; to presume
a meaning in the others, however hid from him; and while
they remain to him a mere inarticulate jargon, to ascribe it
sooner to his own incapacity than to their insignificance.
When God's truth, refracted on its entrance into our nature,
shall emerge into the white light again, not one of these
tinted beams can be spared. Let us for a moment arrest and
examine them. Let us look at the chief varieties which
Christianity assumes as it penetrates the soul; at once recognizing
our own place, and appreciating that of others.</p>

<p>There are three great types of natural mind on which the
Spirit of Christ may fall; and each, touched and awakened by
him, "utters the wonderful works of God" in a language of
its own.</p>

<p>(1.) There is the <i>Ethical</i> mind, calm, level, and clear;
chiefly intent on the good-ordering of this life; judging all
things by their tendency to this end; and impatient of every
oscillation of our nature that swings beyond it. There is
nothing low or unworthy in the attachment which keeps this
spirit close to the present world, and watchful for its affairs.
It is not a selfish feeling, but often one intensely social and
humane; not any mean fascination with mere material interests,
but a devotion to justice and right, and an assertion of
the sacred authority of human duties and affections. A man
thus tempered deals chiefly with this visible life and his comrades
in it, because, as nearest to him, they are the better
known. He plants his standard on the present, as on a vantage-ground,
where he can survey his field, and man&#339;uvre all
his force, and compute the battle he is to fight. Whatever his
bearing towards fervors beyond his range, he has no insensibility
to the claims that fall within his acknowledged province,
and that appeal to him in the native speech of his humanity.
He so reverences veracity, honor, and good faith, as to <i>expect
them</i> like the daylight, and hear of their violation with a flush
of scorn. His word is a rock, and he expects that yours will
not be a quicksand. If you are lax, you cannot hope for his
trust; but if you are in trouble, you easily move his pity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
And the sight of a real oppression, though the sufferer be no
ornamental hero, but black, unsightly, and disreputable, suffices
perhaps to set him to work for life, that he may expunge
the disgrace from the records of mankind. Such men as he
constitute for our world its moral centre of gravity; and whoever
would compute the path of improvement that has brought
it thus far on its way, or trace its sweep into a brighter future,
must take account of their steady mass.</p>

<p>The effect of this style of thought and taste on the <i>religion</i>
of its possessor is not difficult to trace. It <i>may</i>, no doubt,
stop short of avowed and conscious religion altogether; its
basis being simply moral, and its scene temporal, its conditions
may be imagined as complete, without any acknowledgment
of higher relations. But, practically, this is an exceptional
case. A deep and reverential sense of Moral Authority
passes irresistibly into Faith in a Moral Governor; and Conscience,
as it rises, culminates in Worship. And to such natural
religion, the hearty reception of the revealed Gospel is
so congenial a sequel, that Christianity has enlisted its chief
body-guard&mdash;its band of Immortals&mdash;from the writers of
this school. In the <i>form</i> which they give to the faith, they
are true to themselves, still keeping close to the human, and,
except to sanction and glorify this, not apt to dwell upon the
Divine. The second table of commandment has more reality
to them than the first; and the whole of religion presents itself
to their mind under the idea of <i>Law</i>. God in Christ
teaches us his Will; publishes the punishment and the reward;
and requires our obedience; aiding us in it by the
perfect example of Christ, and reassuring us under failure by
the offer of pardon on repentance. Now this is a true Gospel;
not a proposition of it can be gainsaid; and whoever from
his heart can repeat this creed;&mdash;God is holy; morality, divine;
penitence, availing; goodness, immortal; guilt, secure
of retribution; and Christ, our pattern for both lives,&mdash;is not
far from the kingdom of Heaven, and has a faith as much
beyond the practice, as it is short of the professions, of the
great mass of Christians. If he has an equable, rational, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
balanced nature; if he can depend on himself, and reduce his
will to the discipline of rules; if he have affections temperate
enough to follow reason instead of lead it, and to love God
by sense of fitness and word of command; if moral prudence
is so strong in him that he can bear the idea of "doing good
for the sake of everlasting happiness"; if no wing ever beats
in his soul that takes him off his feet;&mdash;his wants are provided;
he has guidance for the problems that will meet him on
his way,&mdash;indications of duty,&mdash;grounds of trust,&mdash;and a
path traced through every Gethsemane and Calvary of this
world, to the saintly peace of another.</p>

<p>But while this is a <i>true Gospel</i>, is it the <i>whole</i> Gospel? Not
so; unless the voice of the Saviour is to reach only a part of
our humanity, and in response draw but a "little flock." For
not many of our race are made of this even and unfermenting
clay. Who can deny that there abound,&mdash;and among the
greatest names of Christian history,&mdash;</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Passionate</i> natures, that cannot thus work out <i>their own
salvation</i>, but ever pray to be taken whither of themselves they
cannot go? It is not that they are necessarily weak of will,
deficient in self-control, and unequal to the human moralities.
Rather is it, that they get through all these, and yet can find
no peace. Duty, as men measure it, may be satisfied; but
still the face of God does not lift up its light. For want of
that answering look, it is all as the tillage of the black desert;
digging by night without a heaven above, and sowing in sands
which no dew shall fertilize. Intense and effectuating resolve
was certainly not wanting in Luther; what his young conscience
imposed, his will achieved,&mdash;wasting asceticism, persevering
devotion, humble charities; yet the shadow of death
brooded around his irreproachable obedience. Is it not that
the same sorrow which, in more level minds, is brought by a
fall of the will, arises in these men from the ascent of their
aspirations? Haunted by the image of God's <i>Holiness</i>, drawn
to it, yet fluttering helplessly at immeasurable depths below
it, they strain after an obedience they cannot reach, and never
lose the sense of infinite failure. Measured by their aims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
their power is nothing. Did the law of Christ require nothing
but works which the hand could do, its conditions would be
finite, and might be satisfied. But its claims sweep through
the affections of the soul; and who can <i>make himself love</i>
where he is cold? who set himself behind his own thoughts,
and keep guilty intruders outside the door of his nature? Impossible!
the inner life, which is the special seat of our divine
concerns, evades our laboring prudence, and tortures conscience
without obeying it. How then do these sufferers find
their emancipation? They have a Gospel, according to which
Christ is not given as the Teacher of Law, but set up as the
personal object of pure Trust and Love. God sent his Son
in the likeness of sinful flesh, to mitigate the Divine into gentleness,
to elevate the Human into holiness, and show how
there is one moral perfection for both; surrendered him to
humiliation and self-sacrifice; placed him in heaven; and offered
to accept pure <i>faith and love towards him</i> as the reconciling
term for the human soul,&mdash;as the substitute for an
unattainable ideal of obedience. Here then is the salvation
of these passionate natures. This simple trust, this intense
affection, is precisely what they have to give. They cannot
direct themselves; but only fix their love, and you may lead
them as a child. Self-discipline is impossible; self-escape triumphant.
Try from within to hold the struggling winds of
their nature with iron bands of law, and you do but stir the
sleeping storms. Set in the heavens without an orb of divine
attraction,&mdash;a new star in the East,&mdash;and you carry their
whole atmosphere away. Engage their faith; and for the
first time they will prevail over their work. Let there be an
appeal of Grace to their enthusiasm,&mdash;a whispered word,
"<i>Lovest thou me?</i>"&mdash;and the very burden that was too heavy
to be borne loses all its weight; and the drudging mill of
habit, that seemed so servile once, they pace with songs and
joy. There are men who so need to be thus carried out of
themselves, that without it their nature runs to waste, or burns
away with self-consuming fires. They are like one who, in a
dream, should set himself to climb a far-off mountain-top; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
he tries to run, he cannot even creep, and only wakes himself
to find that he lies still on the bed of nature. But if the
thought of his mind should be, that an overmastering power&mdash;chariot
of fire and horses of fire&mdash;lifts him away, he
floats through the clear space, till, without effort, his feet stand
upon the visionary hills.</p>

<p>Here then, again,&mdash;in this doctrine of Faith,&mdash;we have a
true Gospel, speaking to many hearts impenetrable by the
doctrine of Works. But have we even yet the <i>whole</i> Gospel?
Has the Good Shepherd, in these two words, made his
voice known to all that are his? Or are there other sheep
still to be gathered that are not of these folds? I believe
<i>there are</i>. For thus far we have looked only at the <i>moral</i> side
of Christian doctrine,&mdash;at its different answers to the problem
of Sin,&mdash;at the conditions of ultimate acceptance with God,
notwithstanding deep unworthiness. Whether you say, Patiently
obey, and you shall grow into perfection of faith and
love; or, Fling yourself on faith and love, and you will find
grace for patient obedience;&mdash;in either case you are prescribing
terms of salvation; you have the <i>future life</i> specially in
mind, and are anxious to make ready the soul <i>there</i> to meet
her God. But there are persons who cannot fix any particular
solicitude upon that crisis, as if all before were probation,
and all after were judgment,&mdash;as if here were only faith in
an absent, and there sight of a present God;&mdash;who cannot
dramatically divide existence into a two-act piece, first Time,
then Eternity, and wait for the Infinite Presence, till the curtain
rises between them; but are haunted by the feeling that,
as Time is in Eternity, so is Man already shut up in God.
This is the indigenous sentiment of another natural type of
mind, which may be called,&mdash;</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>Spiritual</i>. God is a Spirit; man has a spirit;
both, <i>Now</i>; both, <i>Here</i>; and shall they never meet? shall
they remain without exchange of looks? shall nothing break
the seal of eternal silence? is there really love between them,
and thought, and purpose, and yet all recognition dumb?
Why tell us of God's Omniscience, if it only sleeps around us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
like dead space, or at most lies watching, like a sentinel of
the universe, not free to stir? Who could ever pray to this
motionless Immensity? who weep his griefs to rest on a Pity
so secret and reserved? Surely if He is a Living Mind, he
not merely remains over from a Divine Past to appear again
in a Divine Future, but moves through the immediate hours,
and awakens a thousand sanctities to-day. Urged by such
questionings as these, men of meditative piety have thirsted
for conscious communion with the All-holy;&mdash;communion <i>both
ways</i>: appeal and response; a crossing line of light from eye
to eye; a quiet walk with God, where all the dust of life
turns, at his approach, into the green meadow, and its flat
pools into the gliding waters. They have retired <i>within</i> to
meet him; have believed that all is not ours that it is ours to
feel; that there is Grace of his mingling with the inner fibres
of our nature, and flinging in, across the constant warp of our
personality, flying tints of deeper beauty, and hints of a pattern
more divine. And all have agreed, that, in order to reach
this Holy Spirit, and through its vivifying touch be born
again, the one thing needful is a stripping off of self, an abandonment
of personal desire and will, a return to simplicity,
and a docile listening to the whispers spontaneous from God.
They find all sin to be a rising up of self; all return to holiness
and peace a sinking down from self, a free surrender of
the soul,&mdash;that asks nothing, possesses nothing, that relaxes
every rigid strain, and is pliant to go whither the highest Will
may lead. Nature, of her own foolishness, ever goes astray
in her quest of divine things; wandering away in flights of
laboring Reason to find her God; panting with over-plied
resolve to do her work; scheming rules, and artifices, and
bonds of union for forming her individuals into a Church.
Reverse all this, and fall back on the centre of the Spirit, instead
of pressing out in all radii of your own. Let Intellect
droop her ambitious wing, and come home; there, in the inmost
room of conscience, God seeks you all the while. Lash
your wearied strength no more; sit low and weak upon the
ground, with loving readiness hitherward or thitherward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
you shall be taken through your work with a sevenfold strength
that has no effort in it. Leave yourself awhile in utter solitude,
shut out all thoughts of other men, yield up whatever
intervenes, though it be the thinnest film, between your soul
and God; and in this absolute loneliness, the germ of a holy
society will of itself appear, a temper of sympathy and mercy,
trustful and gentle, suffuses itself through the whole mind:
though you have seen no one, you have met all; and are girt
for any errand of service that love may find. So then, if
there were twenty or a thousand in this case, their wills would
flow together of their own accord, and find themselves in
brotherhood without a plan at all.</p>

<p>So speaks this doctrine of the Spirit. It matters not now
under which of its many theologic forms we conceive it; simplest
perhaps, that the Indwelling God, who in Christ was the
Word, is in us the Comforter. But surely, this also is not
altogether a false Gospel. It rescues the conception of direct
communion between the human spirit and the Divine,&mdash;a
conception essential to the Christian life,&mdash;which an Ethical
Gospel does not adequately secure: for communion must be
between like and like, while obedience may be from slave to
lord, nay, in some sense, from machine to maker. Nor is it
a slight thing to take the scales from our eyes that hide from
us the sanctities of our <i>immediate</i> life; to abolish the postponement
of eternity; and, wayfarers as we are, make us feel,
as we rise from our stony pillow and pass on, that here is the
abode of God, and here does the angel-ladder touch the
ground! Yet this too is not the <i>whole</i> Gospel. It absorbs
too much in God. It scarcely saves human personality and
responsibility. It does no justice to nature, which it regards
as the negative of God. It melts away Law in Love, and
hides the rocky structure of this moral world in a sunny haze
that confuses earth and air.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we say of these three types of Christian
faith? Do you doubt their reality? It is demonstrated
within the century which we close this day. For while our
forefathers were dedicating this house of prayer to the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
the Gospel of Christian Duty, Wesley had already become
the prophet of the last,&mdash;the new birth of the Spirit; and
erelong Evangelicism started up, and proclaimed the second,&mdash;the
Salvation by Faith. Do you doubt their durability
and permanence? It is proved by eighteen centuries' experience,
for the New Testament is not older. <i>There</i>, within
the group of sacred books themselves, do they all lie; the Jewish
Gospels represent the first; the Gentile Apostle's letters,
the second; the writings of the beloved disciple, the third.
Matthew, as every reader must remark, is for the Law; Paul,
for Faith; and John, for the Spirit. And, in every age, the
great mass of Christian tendencies break themselves into these
three forms:&mdash;Ebionite, Pauline, and contemplative Gnostic;
Pelagian, Augustinian, and Mystic; Jesuit, Jansenist, and
Quietist; Arminian, Lutheran, and Quaker; all proclaim the
perseverance of the same essential types, wherever the spirit
of Christ alights upon the various heart of man.</p>

<p>Is Christ then divided? Is he not equal to the <i>whole</i> of
our humanity? Rather let us say, that we are small and
weak for the measure of his heavenly wisdom. Doubtless, if
we take what we can hold, and put it to faithful application,
we have grace enough for every personal exigency. But
there is, surely, an evil inseparable from all <i>partial</i> developments
of religion, which only satisfy the immediate cravings
of the mind, and leave parts of our nature&mdash;asleep perhaps
at the moment&mdash;liable to wake and thirst again. Such <i>separate
growths</i> run out their resources and exhaust themselves
in a few generations. At first, they answer to some felt want;
they collect a congenial multitude, and open to them a spiritual
refuge that ends their wanderings. But the sentiment,
once brought into a contented state, ceases to be importunate
and prominent; and by its abatement gives opportunity for
other feelings to vindicate their existence. When the wound
is bound up and has lost its smart, the natural hunger begins
to tell. The children grow up other than the fathers, perhaps
quite as limited, only in different ways,&mdash;with affections
pressing into just the vacant places of an earlier age. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
the imperfection of the original basis has provoked
reactions equally of narrow scope,&mdash;equally incapable of
permanently filling the capacities of the Christian mind.
Hence the danger, if the separate veins of thought be still
worked on as they thin away, that the sects should degenerate
into poor theological egotisms, and wear themselves insensibly
out. It cannot be denied that all the three religious
movements of the last century&mdash;represented by Taylor, by
Wesley, by Cowper&mdash;exhibit the symptoms of spent strength,
and are little likely to play again the part they have played
before.</p>

<p>Yet every one of their Gospels is <i>true at heart</i>; and the
tree that holds that pith is a tree of life, which the Eternal
husbandman hath planted; and if he prune it, it is only that
it may bear more fruit. The weakness of these faiths is in
their isolation; and if their sap could but mingle, if no element
were lost which they can draw from the root of the
vine, a young frondescent life would show itself again. Those
who think that the future can only repeat the past, will deem
this impossible; though least of all should it appear so to <i>us</i>
who profess ourselves "<i>Christians and only Christians</i>,"
pledged to nothing but to lie open to all God's truth. For
myself I indulge a joyful hope that the next century of Christendom
will be nobler than the last; that the great Faiths
which have struggled separately into the light of the one, will
flow together on the broader and less broken surface of the
other. If, however, this is to be, it will arise from no mere
<i>intellectual</i> scrutiny, whose function will ever be to <i>distinguish</i>,
and not to <i>unite</i>, and, in proportion as it dominates
alone, to trace ever-new lines of critical divergency. When
the problem of Christendom is, to deliver the individual mind
from the operation of an overwhelming social power, then it
is seasonable to insist on the principle of free inquiry; because
then you have a dead mass to disintegrate, ere any
young and living force can urge its way. But when you have
won this victory, and when individualism ceases to be devout
and tends to party self-will, the hour comes to proclaim the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
converse lesson, and break up the vain reliance on mere liberty
of thought. Depend upon it, Unity lies in profounder strata
of our nature than any tillage of the mere intellect can reach.
Sink deeply into the inmost life of <i>any</i> Christian faith, and
you will touch the ground of <i>all</i>. Did we do nothing with
our religion except live by it; did we forget the presence of
doubt and contradiction; did it cease to be a creed about
God and become simply an existence in God; did we exchange
self-assertion before men for self-surrender to him;&mdash;we
should find ourselves side by side with unexpected friends,
should be astonished at our petulant divisions, and replace
the poor charity of mutual forbearance by the free consciousness
of inward sympathy. For <i>us</i> especially, who feel the
temptations of an exceptional position, is it the prime duty to
live and move and have our being in the divine sanctities that
hold us, in that which we have <i>not</i> been obliged to throw
away; else might our Gospel be no fruit-bearing branch,
drinking from the root of the vine, but a dead residuum, withered
and hopeless. Remember that, if Sin be not <i>original</i>,
all the more must it be <i>actual</i>, and the deeper should its
shadow lie upon the Conscience, and touch us with the mood
of faithfulness and prayer. If, in reconciling man with God,
there is no <i>vicarious</i> sacrifice possible, so much the more remains
over for <i>self-sacrifice</i>, as the only path of communion
and peace. If you will have it that Christ is only <i>human</i>, so
much the more Divine is your humanity to be; you cannot
assume <i>that</i> as the type of your nature, without at least owning
that its essence lies, and its glory is found, not in the natural
man, but in the spiritual man; and by this very confession,
you renounce the low aims of the worldly mind, and
take on yourself the vows of the saintly. Let believers only
be true to the grace they have, and more will be given; and
enter where they may the many-gated sanctuary of the Christian
life, they will tend ever inwards to the same centre, and
meet at last in the holiest of all. Keeping a reverent eye
fixed on the person and spirit of Christ, they cannot but find
their partial apprehensions corrected and enlarged; for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
divine image is complete in its revelation, and rebukes every
narrower Gospel. Moral perfectness, divine communion,
free self-sacrifice,&mdash;all blend in him,&mdash;indistinguishable elements
of one expression. In that august and holy presence,
our divisions sink abashed, and hear, as of old, the word of
recall, "Ye know not what spirit ye are of." Or if, through
our infirmities, that gracious form, appearing in the midst as
we discourse among ourselves and are perplexed and sad, do
not suffice to open our eyes and make us less slow of heart
to one another and to him, at least in that higher world,
whither our forerunners are gone, his living look will perfect
the communion of saints. There at length the guests of his
bounty will find that, though at separate tables, they have all
been fed by the same bread of life, and touched their lips
with the same wine of remembrance: there, the voices of the
wise, often discordant here,&mdash;of Taylor and Wesley, of Enfield
and Cowper, of Heber and Channing,&mdash;will blend in
harmony;&mdash;and the notes of the last age will not be the
least in that mighty chorus which crowds the steps of eighteen
centuries, and, converging to their immortal Head, sings
the solemn strain, "Great and marvellous are thy works,
Lord God Almighty! Just and true are all thy ways, thou
King of Saints!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>These treatises, bearing on their title-pages the names of
our two ecclesiastical Universities, give happy signs of a new
era in English theology. They show how effectually we
have escaped from the morbid religious phenomena represented
by Simeon at Cambridge, and the counter-irritants
applied by John Henry Newman at Oxford; and come as the
returning breath of nature to those who have witnessed the
fevers of "Evangelical" conversion or the consumptive asceticism
of "Anglican" piety. On looking back, from the
position now attained, it seems wonderful that we could ever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
with St. Paul's writings in our hands, have been betrayed into
either of these opposite extravagances: for anything more
absolutely foreign to his breadth and universality than the
Genevan dogma, or more at variance with his free spirituality
than the sacramental system, it is impossible to conceive.
But it is the peculiar fate of sacred writings, that the last
thing elicited from them is their own real meaning. The
very greatness of their authority puts the reader's faculties
into a false attitude; creates an eagerness,&mdash;an inflexible
intensity,&mdash;that defeats its own end; and, in particular, gives
undue ascendency to the uppermost want and feeling that
may be craving satisfaction. Hence the tendency of Scriptural
interpretation to proceed by action and reaction; an
easy ethical Arminianism being succeeded by a severe Calvinism,
and the reliance on individual grace giving way before
the advance of sacerdotal and Church ideas. When the
opposite errors have spent themselves, the requisite repose of
mind will be recovered for reading just the thought that lies
upon the page: here and there an eye will be found, neither
strained with pre-occupying visions, not scared by sceptic
shadows, but clear for the apprehension of reality, as God has
shaped it for our perception. At length we have reached
this crisis of promise; and critics are found who, instead of
interrogating St. Paul on all sorts of modern questions, listen
to him on his own; and draw from him, not a fancied verdict
on the sixteenth century, but a faithful picture of the first.</p>

<p>And for this historical purpose, the writings of the great
Gentile Apostle are of paramount value, and justly occupy
the inquirer's first researches. The most considerable of
them are of unimpeachable authenticity. They are the very
earliest Christian writings we possess. They are the productions
of a man more clearly known to us than any of the
first missionaries of the Gospel. They are <i>letters</i>: abounding
in disclosures of personal feelings, of biographical incident, of
changing moods of thought, of outward and inward conflict.
They are addressed to young communities, scattered over a
vast area, and composed of differing elements; and exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the whole fermentation of their new life, the scruples, the
heart-burnings, the noble inspirations, the grievous factions,
of the Apostolic age. The Gospels and the Book of Acts
<i>treat</i> no doubt of a prior period, but <i>proceed</i> from a posterior,
of whose state of mind, whose retrospective theories concerning
the ministry of Christ, it is of primary importance to the
criticism of the Evangelists that we should be informed; and
on these points the Pauline Epistles are the indispensable
groundwork of all our knowledge or conjecture. In them we
catch the Christian doctrine and tradition at an earlier stage
than any other canonical book represents throughout. Although
the narratives of the New Testament doubtless abound
in material drawn faithfully from a more primitive time, they
are certainly not free from the touch and tincture of the post-Pauline
age. How powerful an instrument the Apostle's
letters may become for either confirming or checking the
historical records, may be readily conceived by every reader
of Paley's "Horæ Paulinæ." In fine, if it be a just principle,
in historical criticism, to proceed from the more known
to the less known,&mdash;to begin from a date that yields contemporary
documents, and work thence into the subjacent and
superjacent strata of events,&mdash;the elucidation of Christian
antiquity must take its commencement from the Epistles of
St. Paul.</p>

<p>Except in its general similarity of subject, the first of the
three works mentioned at the head of this article admits of
no comparison with the other two. It is rather an illustrated
guide-book to the Apostle's world of place and time, than a
personal introduction to himself. The authors are highly
accomplished and scholarly men, and could not fail, in dealing
with an historical theme, to bring together and group with
conscientious skill a vast store of archæological and topographical
detail; to weigh chronological difficulties with patient
care; to translate with philological precision, and due
aim at accuracy of text. They have accordingly produced a
truly interesting and instructive book: <i>so</i> instructive, indeed,
that by far the greater part of its information would, probably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
have been quite new to St. Paul himself. His life seems to
us to be injudiciously overlaid with what is wholly foreign to
it, and for the sake of picturesque effect to be set upon a stage
quite invisible to him. He was not "Principal of a Collegiate
Institution," accustomed to examine boys in Attic or Latian
geography; was not familiar with Thucydides or Grote; was
indifferent to the Amphictyonic Council; and, in the vicinity
of Salamis and Marathon, probably read the past no
more than a Brahmin would in travelling over Edgehill or
Marston Moor. The world of each man must be measured
from his own spiritual centre, and will take in much less in
one direction, much more in another, than is spread beneath
his eye. He cannot be reached by geographical approaches.
You may determine the elements of his orbit, and yet miss
him after all. It is an illusory process to paint the ancient
world as it would look to an Hellenic gentleman then, or a
university scholar now; and then think how St. Paul would
feel in passing through it to convert it. The indirect influence
of this kind of conception seems to us apparent both in
Mr. Conybeare's translation and Mr. Howson's narrative and
descriptions. The outward scene and conditions of the Apostle's
career are elaborately displayed; but more with the
modern academic than with the old Hebrew tone of coloring;
and the English version, scrupulous and delicate as it is, has,
to our taste, a general flavor quite different from the original
Greek. Unconsciously entangled in the classifications and
symbols of the Protestant theology, the authors are detained
outside the real genius and feeling of the Apostle.</p>

<p>Of a far higher order are the other two works,&mdash;produced,
we infer from their numerous correspondences of both form
and substance, not without concert between the authors. Indeed,
the same explanation of the merits of Lachmann's text
(printed without translation by Mr. Stanley, and with the
adapted authorized version by Mr. Jowett) is made to serve
for both. So clearly and compendiously is this explanation
drawn, that, in the next edition of Lachmann, Mr. Jowett's
introduction might usefully be annexed to the great critic's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
rather tangled and awkward preface. Of the superior fidelity
of this recension, we think no habitual reader of the Greek
Scriptures can reasonably doubt; and the recognition of its
authority fulfils a prior condition of all scientific theology.
The text being chosen on grounds purely critical, the notes
are written in a spirit purely exegetical; they aim, simply
and with rare self-abnegation, to bring out, by every happy
change of light and turn of reflective sympathy, the great
Apostle's real thought and feeling. How very far this faithful
historic purpose in itself raises the interpreter above the
crowd of erudite and commenting divines, can scarcely be
understood till it has formed a new generation, and fixed itself
as a distinct intellectual type. It is not, however, an
affair of mere will and disposition; but, like most of the
higher exercises of veracity, comes into operation only as the
last result of mental tact and affluence. With the most
honest intentions towards St. Paul, a critic without psychological
insight and dialectic pliancy, without power of melting
down his modern abstractions and redistributing them in the
moulds of the old realistic thought,&mdash;a critic without entrance
into the passionate depths of human nature,&mdash;a critic
pre-occupied by Catholic or Protestant assumptions, and untrained
to imagine the questions and interests of the first age,&mdash;<i>cannot</i>
surrender himself to the natural impression of the
Apostle's language. The disciple and the master are, in such
case, at cross-purposes with one another; the questions put
are not the questions answered; the interlocutors do not really
meet, but wind in a maze about each other's <i>loci</i>, not to end
till the unconscious interpreter has set his fantasies within
the shadow of inspiration. No such blind chase is possible
to our authors. They have achieved the conditions of fidelity;
and bring to a task, in which the truthful and sagacious spirit
of Locke had already fixed the standard high, the ampler
resources of modern learning, and more practised habit of
historic combination. In the distribution of their work, the
difference of natural genius between the two authors has perhaps
been consulted, and is, at all events, distinctly expressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
Mr. Stanley's aptitude for reproducing the image of the past,
his apprehensive sympathy with the concrete and individual
elements of the world, fitly engage themselves with the composite
forms of Corinthian society, and the most personal,
various, and objective of the Apostle's letters. For the more
speculative Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, there
was need of Mr. Jowett's philosophical depth and subtilty.
The strictness with which he restrains these seductive gifts to
the proper business of the interpreter, is not less admirable
than their occasional happy application. Instead of being
employed to force upon the Apostle a logical precision foreign
to his habit, they are chiefly engaged in detecting and wiping
out false niceties of distinction drawn by later theology,
and throwing back each doctrinal statement into its original
degree of indeterminateness. It is not in the notes,&mdash;which
are wholly occupied in recovering St. Paul's own thought,&mdash;but
in the interposed disquisitions, which avowedly deal with
the theology of to-day, that a certain breadth and balance of
statement, and delicate ease in man&#339;uvring the forms and
antitheses of abstract thought, and fine appreciation of human
experience, make us feel the double presence of metaphysical
power and historical tact. The author, accordingly, appears
to us, not only to have seized the great Apostle's attitude of
mind more happily than any preceding English critic, but
also to have separated the essence from the accidents of the
Pauline Christianity, and disengaged its divine elements for
transfusion into the organism of our immediate life. Mr.
Stanley appears to have more difficulty in unreservedly adhering
to the purely historical view, and clerically flutters,
without clear occasion, on the outskirts of "edification";&mdash;the
critic in his notes, the preacher in his paraphrase; conceding
in act more readily than in name, and apologizing for finding
human ingredients in the Apostles and their doctrines, as
if it were he, and not <i>God</i>, that would have them there. This
tendency to blur the lines which he himself draws between
the temporary and the permanent in the Scriptures with
which he deals, is the only fault we can find with Mr. Stanley;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
whose associate, clinging less to the past, in effect preserves
more for the present. To learn the external scene of
the Apostle's career, we would refer our readers to Messrs.
Conybeare and Howson; to appreciate his moral surroundings,
and the problems it presented, especially on the ethnic
side, they may take Mr. Stanley as their guide; but for insight
into the Apostle himself, and outlook on the world as it
seemed to him, they must resort to Mr. Jowett.</p>

<p>The Pauline Epistles are interesting, apart from all assumption
of inspired authority, because the elements are seen fermenting
there of the greatest known revolution both in the
history of the world and in the spiritual consciousness of individual
man. Judaism was the narrowest (that is, the most
<i>special</i>) of religions; Christianity, the most human and comprehensive.
Within a few years, the latter was evolved out of
the former; taking all its intensity and durability, without
resort to any of its limitations. This marvellous expansion of
the national into the universal was not achieved without a process
and a conflict. Divine though the work was, it had to be
wrought upon men, and through men, whose character, interests,
convictions, habits, and institutions furnished the data
conditioning the problem, and whose remodelled affections and
will supplied the instruments for its solution. The laws of human
nature, therefore, and the action of human events, necessarily
enter into the study of this great revolution; and it cannot
be detained out of the hands of the historian by any exclusive
rights of the divine. When we endeavor to trace the successive
steps of faith from Mount Zion to the Vatican, many parts
of the progress appear to have left but scanty vestige. We
know the beginning, in the doctrine of the Hebrew Messiah;
we know the end, in the recognition of a Saviour of the world.
We know the intermediate fact,&mdash;that Judaism did not surrender
its own without a struggle, or readily give away the
keys of its enclosure just when it was passing from a prison of
affliction into a palace of "the kingdom." But within this
general fact lies a world of mysterious detail,&mdash;nay, almost
the whole life of the early Church. Who began the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
breach between Messiah and the Law? how, and to what extent,
did the parties divide? what was their relative magnitude
at different times and in different places? and by what process
was the difference terminated, and the two extremes&mdash;Marcion
on the one hand and the Ebionites on the other&mdash;removed
outside as heretics? The Christianity of the third
century is so little like the doctrine of Matthew's Gospel as to
perplex our sense of identity. No one can bring the two into
direct comparison, without feeling how much must have happened
to shape the earlier into the form of the later. Could
we trace the flow and estimate the sources of this change, the
most wonderful of the world's experiences would be resolved.
The continuity, however, of visible causation is often broken;
there are everywhere many missing links in the chain, and a
chasm extending through a large part of the second century.
But a generation earlier we meet with materials of the richest
value in the Epistles of St. Paul; and by their aid the
general direction may be found by which thought and events
must have advanced. Otherwise, the change would seem as
violent and inconceivable as a convulsion that should mingle
the Jordan and the Tiber.</p>

<p>No doubt, the germ of the Gospel's universality is to be
found in the personal characteristics of its Author,&mdash;in the
whole spirit of his life, and the direct tendency of his teachings.
He who found in the love of God and love of man the
very springs of eternal life; who measured good and evil, not
by the act, but by the affection whence they come; who
placed his ideal for man in likeness to the perfection of God,&mdash;had
already proclaimed a religion transcending all local
limits. Nay, if he opposed the "true worship" to the services
at Gerizim and Jerusalem, and could wish the Temple away,
that obstructed his direct dealing with the human soul and
suppressed the inner shrine "not made with hands," he
must even have placed himself in an attitude of open alienation
towards the ritual of his people. At the same time, his
words seem to have left not unfrequently an opposite impression.
He comes, "not to destroy the Law and the prophets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
but to fulfil" them; "not a jot or a tittle is to fail." His
most spiritual truths and sentiments, instead of being announced
as novelties grounding themselves on his personal
authority, are drawn out of the old Hebrew Scriptures; and
even the life beyond death he finds lurking in patriarchal idioms
and phrases heard at the burning bush. His intensest
polemic against the sacerdotal party goes on within the limits
of the system which they represent and yet corrupt; and his
bitterest reproach against them is that there is no reverence
for it in their hearts, since they hugely violate and trivially
obey it. Far from ever launching out against law <i>as</i> law, or
setting up faith as a rival principle excluding it, he extends
<i>precept</i> to the last heights of religion, <i>enjoins</i> the divinest affections,
as if <i>there also</i> obedience was possible, and duty and
volition had their place. It was not in a nature holy and
harmonious as his,&mdash;type of heavenly peace rather than of
earthly conflict,&mdash;that the schism would be exhibited between
Will and Love; where both are at their height, there is no
rent between them. Nor was there need, in that meek, reverential
soul, to break with the past, in order to find a sanctity
for the present, and leave an inspiration for the future.
Some things, once given for the hardness of men's hearts,
might be dropped, and fall behind; but God had ever lived,
and left the trace of his perfectness upon the elder times as
on the newest manifestations of the hour. There was enough
in the Law, if only its fruitful seeds were warmed into life, to
furnish forth the Gospel. And so Christ presents himself as
the disciple of Moses, and in the Sermon on the Mount does
but open out the tables of Sinai. It was not, therefore, without
honest ground that his immediate disciples could defend
him from the charge of being unfaithful to the religion of his
native land. And yet the instinct of the priests and rabbis
told them truly that he and they could not co-exist, that his
doctrine reduced their work to naught, and that, whencesoever
he might draw it, there was no doubt whither he must
carry it. The "witnesses" were not altogether "false"
which they brought to show his inner hostility to the altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
ceremonial; and perhaps his enemies, with apprehension
sharpened by fear, more correctly interpreted his tendency in
this direction than his followers, entangled in the cloud of a
Judaic love. It was quite natural that the real antithesis between
the Law and the Gospel should thus be first felt by his
antagonists, whilst as yet it slept undeveloped in the minds of
his followers and in the habitual expression of his own
thought; and that its earliest proclamation should be <i>their</i>
act, <i>their</i> defiance, the cross on Calvary!</p>

<p>This terrible challenge, fiercely protesting that the Law
would hold no parley with the Gospel, the Apostles, however,
refused to accept. They still denied their Lord's apostasy
or their own; they had always been, and with his encouragement,
the best of Jews: nor did they contemplate, so far, any
change. The crucifixion was a Jewish mistake, meant for
the nation's enemy, but alighting on its representative; a
mistake, however, which God had counteracted by a glorious
rescue, in the resurrection of the crucified. The mischief
being thus undone, the day of Hebrew opportunity was resumed;
the ministry of Jesus was not closed; he yet lived
and preached to them as before;&mdash;no longer, indeed, in person
till their better mind should re-assert itself, but by "faithful
witnesses";&mdash;no longer too in tentative disguise, but now
identified as Messiah by his exaltation above this world.
Whatever conflicts of mind the disciples suffered in the mysterious
period following the crucifixion, the operation of the
resurrection and the Spirit was at first simply to reinstate
them in their prior faith,&mdash;that the kingdom would soon be
restored to Israel, and be brought in by no other than their
Master, already waiting for the crisis in a higher world till
God's hour should come. There is no evidence to show that,
on the transference of their Lord's life from earth to heaven,
they were carried into any greater comprehensiveness or
spirituality of faith: their convictions were more intense, but
held on in the same direction, being all included in one great
theme,&mdash;the speedy coming of Messiah's kingdom and the
end of the world. Nay, of so little consequence, in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
with this <i>general</i> picture of expectation, was even the
appearance in it of the person of Jesus as its central figure,
that Apollos, more than twenty years afterwards, was making
and baptizing converts, without having ever heard of any later
prophet than John the Baptist; and these people are already
recognized as "disciples," and then informed, as needful
complement to their faith, that, besides the crisis being near,
the person is appointed.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Here had evidently been, for some
quarter of a century, two independent streams of Messianic
faith, one from a rather earlier source than the other, but
pursuing their own separate way, till thus partially confluent
at Ephesus. And what is the relation between them? One
of them baptizes into an impersonal and anonymous hope,
the other into the same hope with the name attached. And
when these two states of mind are set side by side, they are
regarded as the same in their essence, and differing only in
completeness. Nor is there anything in their mutual feeling
to hinder their instant coalescence. This fact defines in the
clearest way the position of the early Church; the ordinary
Jew believed that Messiah would <i>some time</i> come, and bring
in "the last days"; Apollos, that he would come <i>erelong</i>;
the Christians, that already <i>the person</i> was indicated, and
would prove to be Jesus of Nazareth. All three co-existed
within the Hebrew pale, and the two last fall under the common
category of "disciples."</p>

<p>It was impossible, however, that the contemplation of a
Messiah risen and reserved in heaven should affect all the
believers in a precisely similar manner. His personal attendants
it would take up just where the crucifixion had let them
down; would give new force to their previous impressions,
new sacredness to their recollections, new significance to his
words and example, new reluctance to venture where he had
not led. The whole effect would be conservative, and tend
to fix them, with an inspired rigor, within the limits of the
Master's lot and life. Quite otherwise was it with the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
disciples, who had no such restraining memories of the human
Teacher. <i>They</i> began with Christ above, and were tied
down by no concrete biographical images, no scruples of
tender retrospect. They were free to ask themselves, "What
meant this surprising way of revealing Messiah 'in heavenly
places,' and letting his disguise first fall off in his escape from
local relations? The scene from which he looked down,&mdash;was
it the mere upper chamber of Judæa, or did it overarch
the human world? Who could claim him, now that he was
there? Was it for him to examine pedigrees to test 'the
children of the kingdom'; or would he, as Son of David,
even come emblazoned with his own?" The mere conception
of an ascended and immortal being, assessor to the Lord of
<i>all</i>, seemed to dwarf and shame all provincial restrictions, and
sanction the distaste for binding forms and ceremonial exclusiveness.
The withdrawal of Christ to a holier sphere accorded
well with all that was most spiritual in his teachings
and in himself; and could not fail to reflect a strong light
back on this aspect of his life, and give a more significant
emphasis to the tradition of his deepest words. In the mind
of many a disciple this tendency would be favored by a weariness
towards the outer worship of the temple, and a secret
aspiration after purer and more intimate communion with
God. Especially was the <i>foreign</i> Jew obliged to confess
such a feeling to himself. The very speaking of Greek
spoiled him for thinking as a Hebrew; for language is the
channel of the soul, and according as the organism is open,
the sap will flow. Accustomed to the simple piety of the
Proseucha, where God was sought without priest or sacrifice,
and adequately found in poetry, and prophecy, and prayer, the
Hellenist acquired a tone of sentiment on which the material
pomps and puerilities of Mount Moriah painfully jarred. Nor
could he enclose himself contentedly, like the Palestine Jew,
within the sacred boundary that admitted the most worthless
son of Abraham, and shut the noblest Gentile out. Living
in heathen cities, dealing with heathen men, touched at times
with the sorrow or the goodness of heathen neighbors, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
moral feeling fell into contradiction with his inherited exclusiveness,
and inwardly demanded some other providential
classification of mankind. Accordingly, it was the Hellenist
Stephen who first saw, in the heavenly Christ, a principle of
universal religion and a proclamation of spiritual worship.
When accused of defaming Moses and the Law and the holy
place, and setting up Jesus to supersede them, he boldly reflects
on the stone Temple, rooted to one spot, as at variance
with His nature who said, "Heaven is my throne, and earth
my footstool," and points to the earlier tabernacle, movable
from place to place, following the steps of wandering humanity,
as truer emblem of a faith that takes every winding of
history, and a God who goes where we go, and stays where
we stay.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This noble doctrine doubtless expressed a feeling
common among the foreign Jews of liberal culture and fervid
piety; and when consecrated by Stephen's martyrdom, it
would assume a distinctness unknown before, and become the
admitted type of belief among the Christian Hellenists. That
it was confined to them is evident from the partial effect of
the persecution in which Stephen fell. <i>His</i> friends,&mdash;perhaps
we may say his <i>party</i>,&mdash;hunted from house to house,
fled from Jerusalem; but the Jewish Apostles remained where
they were,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> apparently unmenaced and undisturbed. The
hostility of the city drew therefore a distinction between such
Hebrew Christians as the twelve, and the freer "Grecians"
who proclaimed a Spirit above the Temple and the Law.
The former, constituting an inner sect of Judaism, might hold
their ground unmolested; the latter were treated as apostates,
and "scattered abroad." The essential, but hitherto dormant,
antithesis between the Gospel and the Law, had thus burst
into expression, and embodied itself in two sections of the
Church that grew ever more distinct; the Hebrew party concentrated
in Jerusalem, and remaining intensely national; the
Hellenistic, spreading itself on the outskirts of Palestine,
and erelong fixing its head-quarters at Antioch. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
this freer circle, first as persecutor, soon as disciple, appears
Saul of Tarsus. So congenial are its tendencies and aspirations
with his nature and his antecedent position, that his
hostile attitude towards it might well strike him, on looking
back, as a monstrous self-contradiction. A foreigner to Palestine,
a "citizen of no mean city," familiar with a trade that
bought from the shepherds of Mount Taurus, and sold to the
Greek skippers of the Levant, he knew the human side of
the Gentile world too well to rest in a narrow Judaism. We
cannot imagine his fervid, free-moving mind, content to live
within the enclosure of Rabbinical niceties, or able to find, in
the materialism of the Temple rites, his ideal of true worship.
With sympathies essentially cosmopolitan, he could scarcely
fail to be disappointed, not to say repelled, by Jerusalem,&mdash;so
different from the dream of his young romance. Some
higher, fresher communion between earth and heaven, some
wider monarchy for God than over a mere clan, would be to
him natural objects of aspiration. Hence his first persecuting
attitude towards the Christian Hellenists was permanently
untenable; and as he went amongst them, words were sure
to fall upon his ear, and holy looks to meet his eye, that
would smite him with a kindred affection. Whether the
death of Stephen left on his mind images which he could not
banish, and commenced a reaction which no plunge into
fresh violences could arrest, it is vain to conjecture. That it
should be so, would be only human; for in the life of passion,
triumph and humiliation are near neighbors, and often the
last note in the song of exultation dies down into the plaint
of compunction. Certain it is, that shortly afterwards it
"pleased God to reveal his Son in him"; that, with the
suddenness characteristic of impassioned natures, he came to
himself, and found his proper work, "to which he had been
set apart from his mother's womb"; and that his new convictions
were of the very same type and tendency with Stephen's,
and strongly discriminated from the Messianic doctrine of the
twelve at Jerusalem. The incipient breach between Law and
Gospel, latent in the Master, denied by the twelve, bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
forth among the Hellenists, finally realized and defined itself
in Paul; whose intense impulses were too great for the custody
of his will; whose soul had wings to fly, but not feet to
plod; who felt himself the theatre of living powers not his
own, and could find no peace till, by communion with the
heavenly Son of God, he discovered a providential love universal
as human life, and a way of reconciliation quick and
open as human trust and reverence. It is easier to speak of
the effects than of the nature of his conversion. His writings
exhibit its results, but only vaguely allude to its occurrence,
and never in terms at all resembling the recitals in
the Book of Acts, or abating their discrepancies. Of these
narratives (Acts ix. 1-9, xxii. 6-12, xxvi. 12-18) Mr.
Jowett remarks, "There is no use in attempting any forced
reconcilement." (I. 229.) On the one hand, "There is no
fact in history more certain or undisputed than that, in some
way or other, by an inward vision or revelation of the Lord,
or by an outward miraculous appearance as he was going to
Damascus, the Apostle was suddenly converted from being a
persecutor to become a preacher of the Gospel." (I. 227.)
On the other, "If we submit the narrative of the Acts to the
ordinary rules of evidence, we shall scarcely find ourselves
able to determine whether any outward fact was intended by
it or not." This, however, is of the less moment, because it is
evident from the language of the Epistle to the Galatians
(Gal. i. 15, 16) that,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whether the conversion of St. Paul was an outward or
an inward fact, it was not principally the outward appearance
in the heavens, but the inward effect, that the Apostle would
have regarded. Compare Eph. iii. 3: 'How that by revelation
he made known unto me the mystery (as I wrote afore
in few words).'</p>

<p>"It has been often remarked, that miracles are not appealed
to singly in Scripture as evidences of religion, in the
same way that they have been used by modern writers. Especially
does this remark apply to the conversion of St. Paul.
Not a hint is found in his writings, that he regarded 'the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
heavenly vision' as an objective evidence of Christianity.
The evidence to him was the sudden change of heart; what
he terms, in the case of his converts, the reception of the
Spirit; what he had known, and what he felt; the fact that
one instant he was a persecutor, and the second a preacher of
the Gospel. The last inquiry that he would have thought of
making, would be that of modern theologians: 'How, without
some outward sign, he could be assured of the reality of
what he had seen and heard.' No outward sign could, as
such, have convinced the mind of a man who fell to the
ground amazed, unless it were certain that his companions
had seen the light and heard the voice. Nor unless they had
distinctly been partakers of the supernatural vision could he
ever have been satisfied that what they saw was anything but
a meteor, or lightning, or that the voice they heard was more
than the sound of thunder. No evidence of theirs would
have been an answer to the language of some of the rationalist
divines: 'St. Paul was overtaken by a storm of thunder
and lightning in the neighborhood of Damascus.' Such difficulties
are insuperable; at best we can only raise probabilities
in answer to them, based on the general tone of the
narrative in Acts ix. But we may remember that the belief
in some outward fact was not the essential point in St. Paul's
faith, and therefore we need not make it the essential point
in our own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"It is not upon the testimony of any single person, even
were it far more distinct than in the present instance, we can
venture to peril the truth of the Christian religion. Weak
defences of comparatively unimportant points, undermine
more than they support. He who has the Spirit of Christ
and his Apostles, has the witness in himself; he who leads
the life of Paul, has already set his seal that his words are
true. Were the other view supported by the most irrefragable
historical evidence,&mdash;had the sign in the clouds been
beheld by whole multitudes of Jews and Gentiles, believers
and unbelievers,&mdash;it is to the internal aspect of the event we
should be more inclined to turn, both as the more religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
one, and the one which more closely links the Apostle with
ourselves."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 230.</p>

<p>With the essentially inward character of this crisis, the
substance of the revelation involved in it strikingly corresponds.</p>

<p>"It was spiritual rather than historical; a revelation of
Christ in him, not external information brought to him. It
was the ever-growing sense of union with Christ, imparted,
not in one revelation, but many; not only by special revelation,
but as the inward experience of a long life, from which
his union in Christ with all mankind, and his mission to
preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, were from the beginning
inseparable; as a part of which the image of the meekness
and gentleness of Christ formed itself in him, not without the
remembrance that he had 'seen' Him who was now passed
into the heavens."&mdash;Jowett, Vol. I. p. 216.</p>

<p>Since the Apostle "nowhere speaks of any special truths
or doctrines as imparted to himself" (I. 72); since he never
dwells on the life of Christ, the miracles, the parables, so that
it is even doubtful what he knew of them; and since his
whole appeal is either, (1.) to the witness of the Hebrew
Scriptures, or (2.) to historical testimony, or (3.) to the assurance
of the living Spirit,&mdash;it is evident that his conversion
chiefly gave him that inward image of Christ crucified
and risen, which attended him through all his years, and so
lived in him as to take the place of his personality, and
coalesce with his spiritual affections, and do the work of his
will.</p>

<p>Of the Apostle's mode of thought when fresh from his conversion
no memorial exists; his earliest extant writing being
of a date fourteen or fifteen years later, and the report in the
Book of Acts not being altogether reliable&mdash;as Mr. Jowett
has shown<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>&mdash;for historical accuracy. But we learn from
his own remarkable statement to the Galatians, that he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
aloof from the churches in Judæa, and was unknown to
them by face; that it was three years before he entered Jerusalem,
or saw an Apostle; that he then made acquaintance
with Peter, and met James, but without its affecting his independent
course, which ran through eleven years more ere it
brought him to Jerusalem again; that his errand, on this second
visit, was to take security against being thwarted by
Jewish jealousies sanctioned at head-quarters; that from
James, Cephas, and John&mdash;the "seeming pillars" of the
Church&mdash;he learnt nothing that he cared to hear; that they,
on the other hand, could not gainsay the independent rights
of so fruitful an apostleship, and agreed with him not to cross
his path, if he would leave them theirs. The emphasis with
which, in this animated passage, St. Paul dwells on the separate
sources of his own faith, and disowns any obligation to
the prior Apostles, renders it certain that the biography, the
discourses, the human personality of Jesus, were indifferent to
him; and that with only the cross and the resurrection (contained
as data in the vision of conversion) he could construct
his scheme. The unmistakable sarcasm of the expressions,
οι δοκουντες,&mdash;δοκουντες
ειναι τι&mdash;οι δοκουντες στυλοι ειναι,&mdash;betrays
a state of mind, in regard to the twelve, out of all
sympathy with the grounds of their authority. And the necessity,
in order to agreement, of marking out for each, not a
separate geographical beat, but a distinct religious and ethnologic
ground, shows that, with external mutual toleration,
there is yet wanting the inner unity of an identic faith. Only
in the absence of a common Gospel would each party have to
take its own, and spare the other. Indeed, the difference was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
so fundamental as to involve everything that St. Paul then,
and Christians now, would deem characteristic of their religion.</p>

<p>The question was this,&mdash;"How might a born Gentile become
a Christian?"&mdash;"By becoming a Jew first, and then
accepting Jesus as appointed to be the Jews' Messiah," was
the answer at Jerusalem. "By believing in Jesus straightway,"
was the reply of Paul. With irresistible force he
contended that, according to his opponents' view, the Gospel
opened no door at all, and was simply nugatory. For it had
<i>always</i> been possible for a Gentile to become a Jew; and if,
without this step, faith in Christ was unavailing, the real efficacy
must lie in what the Jew brought to Christ, not in what
he received from him; so that it was hard to say what good
there could be in passing on from Moses at all, or what essential
difference between the unconverted and the converted
Hebrew. And, in truth, they were <i>not</i> strongly contrasted in
Jerusalem; and in habit, thought, and feeling, the twelve
were probably much nearer to Gamaliel than to Paul. The
altercation between Peter and Paul at Antioch is full of instruction
on this point; proving, as it does, that the intensest
form of ritual exclusiveness&mdash;the refusal to partake at table
with the uncircumcised&mdash;was retained in the parent church,
and enforced with jealous vigilance. In the Syrian capital
the Gentile disciples were numerous, the Pauline comprehensiveness
prevailed, and the intercourses of life were unhindered
by ceremonial scruples. Peter, thrown amongst them
on a visit, yields to the local impression, and, as long as he can
do so unobserved, falls in with their free ways; feeling all the
while, no doubt, like the Quaker from home tempted into a
ball-dress or regimentals. Soon, however, the strict brethren
at Jerusalem send to look after him or the Antiochians, and
instantly his liberality is gone; he is the prim Jew again, and
the Gentile dishes are all unclean. And who then are these
new witnesses, that he should fear their report? They are
deputies from James, "the brother of the Lord," who, on
account of this affinity,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was the recognized head of the Judæan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
Christians; and of whose ascetic abstinences, and constant
devotions <i>on the temple pavement</i>, till "his knees were
become like the knees of a camel," Hegesippus preserved the
tradition.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It was clear, therefore, that Peter's association
with the Gentile Christians was exceptional,&mdash;a violation of
his professed rule, and of the allowed usage of the Apostolic
Church. To own brotherhood with the uncircumcised believer,
was a forfeiture of character, probably an outrage on his
own conscience, to the Christian Apostle! This was the result,
among his first disciples, of nearly twenty years' belief of
Christ in heaven. There could be no real sympathy between
such an evangile and Paul's. It let him make converts, but
would not acknowledge them when made. It could not resist
the fact of his success, but treated his "children in the faith"
as in a doubtful case, left to Heaven's "uncovenanted mercies,"
and needing to be put in a securer state, as soon as his
back was turned, and teachers could be sent to complete
the task. Hence the opposition that tracked the steps, and so
much marred the work of the Apostle, wherever he went;
and in repelling which he wrote his chief Epistles, and matured
the form of his great theology. Mr. Jowett, whilst
allowing that this opposition was systematic and persistent,
and in some degree connived at by the twelve, is yet anxious
to lay it mainly to the charge of their followers, and defines
the relation of the two sections thus: "Separation, not opposition;
antagonism of the followers rather than of the leaders;
personal antipathy of the Judaizers to St. Paul, rather
than of St. Paul to the twelve." (I. 326.) These are fine distinctions,
and for this very reason likely, we fear, in the rough
movement of human passions, to be more ideal than real.
True, the feeling of a leader is ever apt to run into exaggeration
among the followers; nor probably was Apostolic control
over the mass of believers so complete as to exclude this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
danger. But the Epistle to the Galatians is written by one
leader, and speaks of the others; and the impression it conveys
is surely one of very decided antagonism, and that, too,
not accidental, but depending on permanent differences of
principle, which discussion did not smooth away, and which
penetrated into the very organism of daily life. In the altercation
with Peter, what was the point of Paul's rebuke?
Did he simply censure his moral weakness and inconsistency?
Not so, or he would have exhorted him to take whichever
course he approved, and stick to it. Did he find fault with
his <i>exceptional</i> act, of eating with the Gentile Christians?
Not so, for he did the same himself. The thing he blamed
was nothing less than the rule and usage by which Peter
<i>habitually lived</i>, and which, it is declared, virtually made
Christ of none effect. Here was a collision of irreconcilable
principles, and every subsequent occasion of personal contact,
under like conditions, would be as liable to produce it as
the first. Nor have we, in fact, any reason to suppose a closer
approximation at a later part of the Apostolic age. That
Paul looked with any particular respect on the other Apostles,
is surely not proved, as Mr. Jowett imagines, by his appeal
(1 Cor. xv. 5) to their testimony respecting the <i>fact</i> of their
Lord's resurrection, or by his claiming (1 Cor. ix. 5) to stand
on a like footing of privilege with them.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> To produce the
spectators of an event as its proper witnesses, is no expression
of feeling towards them at all; and to say, "Are the other
Apostles to have the right of taking their wives with them at
the cost of the Church, and may not I take or decline my
mere personal maintenance as I think proper?" institutes a
comparison in which it is difficult to discover any strong sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
of "respect." Nor do the doctrinal agreements, of
which, as well as of the personal relations of fellowship, our
author makes the most, amount to any substantial concurrence,
when we penetrate to the essence from the form. On
both sides, says Mr. Jowett, the disciples were baptized into
the <i>same name</i>. (I. 340.) Yes; but how different the <i>object
named</i> as present to their thought; in the one case, the human
life in its detail, with the resurrection as its crown; in
the other, the cross of Christ that stands between them, and
his life in heaven that passes beyond them! Both sections,
it is again said, find their <i>ground</i> in the Old Testament. (I.
341.) True: but the one on Moses, the tables, and the holy
place; the other, on Adam's nature, and the patriarchs' freedom,
and the prophets' insight; the one, moreover, using the
ground to intrench the Law for ever; the other, to drive
the ploughshare over its ruins, and make it a fruitful field.
Once more, it is said that on both sides there was a looking
for "the day of the Lord," an expectation of Christ's return
to end the world within that generation. (I. 341.)
Assuredly, but with such differences in the vision, that, in the
apocalyptic picture of the one, Paul is not among the Apostles,
or his followers among the white-robed and crowned (Rev.
xxi. 14, and ii. 2, 14, 20); while in that of the other, the
advent will but perfect and perpetuate a union with Christ,
already present to their consciousness, and open to all who
live with him in the Spirit. In short, twenty years after the
death of Christ, the two elements that were harmonized in
him, but are ever apt to part in our imperfect minds, the ethical
and the mystical, the historical and spiritual, ascetic concentration
and outspreading trust, fell into determinate antithesis,
realizing their conflict in the immediate question of Jew
and Gentile, and finding their respective representatives in
the twelve and St. Paul.</p>

<p>Whether, besides and beyond this general development of
the Christian system, there was also a special development of
doctrine into higher degrees of spirituality within the mind of
St. Paul himself, is a question of less interest and more difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
Both Mr. Stanley and Mr. Jowett find traces of such
a change in the modified sentiment of his later writings, and
even make the Apostle himself depose to his own enlargement
of view. We must confess that this speculation, though
excluded by no antecedent improbability, appears to us less
well supported than anything in these volumes. It is ingeniously
presented and argued by Mr. Jowett in his introduction
to the Thessalonian Epistles; and by means of it he explains
the marked absence from these letters of St. Paul's
usual topics and manner, and gets rid of the objection urged
on this ground to their authenticity. Applied at the other
end of the Apostle's career, the hypothesis accounts for the
prominence, in the Epistles to the Ephesians, Philippians,
and Colossians, of certain conceptions, doubtfully traceable
elsewhere, of the place of Christ in the hierarchy of the
universe, and of his union with his disciples as his "body."
The pastorals may be left out of consideration, as their mixed
phenomena cannot be much used in the service of this theory.
The broad facts are undoubted,&mdash;that the four great central
Epistles (Galatians, Corinthians, Romans) must be taken as
our foci of authority for the characteristics of St. Paul; that,
in the earlier Thessalonians, these characteristics are overshadowed
by the more Judaic doctrine of the "day of the
Lord," and in the later Ephesians, &amp;c., by the more Gnostic
conception of a spiritual hierarchy and pleroma. But these
facts are quite overworked when set to prove our author's
thesis. In order to establish a process of personal development,
they ought to exhibit certain natural links of psychological
and moral succession, and not mere abrupt and unrelated
contrasts of subject. To look for such organic indications
in the sparse productions of the Apostle's pen, is to ask
too much from a few incidental letters, bearing to his whole
life the proportion of a dozen pages of random excerpts to a
cyclopædia. If only the matters treated be different, the
whole group of writings may very well express, in its several
parts and aspects, one simultaneous state of mind. If the
types of thought be such as could scarcely co-exist, the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
may be sought as reasonably in a plurality of authors as in a
succession of beliefs in the same author; and only a most
delicate combination of symptoms can rescue the problem
from this indeterminate state of double solution. Nor ought
we to forget, in weighing the probabilities, that the whole set
of Epistles comprising the phenomena of difference were
written within nine years; and that, ere the first of them was
produced, St. Paul had been a convert fifteen years, and had
reached the age of fifty. The earlier and longer of these
periods is a more natural seat of mental change than the
later and shorter; especially of a change not apparent so
much in particular judgments and opinions, as in the whole
complexion of spiritual feeling and idea.</p>

<p>But, we are assured, the Apostle directly testifies to his
own progress in doctrine; and intimates (2 Cor. v. 16) that
there was a time when he had "known Christ according to
the flesh,"&mdash;had preached him "in a more Jewish and less
spiritual manner,"&mdash;though "henceforth he would know him
so no more." Mr. Stanley, explaining this much-disputed
phrase, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Probably, he must be here alluding to those who laid
stress on their having seen Christ in Palestine, or on their
connection with him or with 'the brothers of the Lord' by
actual descent; and if so, they were probably of the party
'<i>of Christ</i>.' But the words lead us to infer that something
of this kind had once been his own state of mind, not only in
the time before his conversion (which he would have condemned
more strongly), but since. If so, it is (like Phil. iii.
13-15) a remarkable confession of former weakness and
error, and of conscious progress in religious knowledge."&mdash;Vol.
II. p. 106.</p>

<p>Did St. Paul then ever "lay stress on having seen Christ
in Palestine"? or on actual blood-connection with him? or
on "something of this kind"? To personal relations with
Jesus in his ministry or family he had no pretensions; and
the spirit with which he had <i>always</i> treated everything "of
this kind," is so apparent from his narrative to the Galatians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
as to contradict Mr. Stanley's inference. Mr. Jowett gives
the phrase a different turn. Finding (Gal. v. 11) the Apostle
charged with at one time "preaching circumcision," he accepts
this as synonymous with "knowing Christ according to the
flesh" (i. 12). This, however, would imply that he was
originally no "Apostle to the Gentiles," but insisted on <i>mediate</i>
conversion into the Gospel through the law. Feeling the
irreconcilable variance of such an hypothesis with the autobiographical
notices in the Epistles, Mr. Jowett lowers his
phraseology, and attributes to St. Paul's early teaching only
such sentiments as "<i>might be thought</i>" to make him "a
preacher of the circumcision." And so we lose ourselves
again in "something of the kind." Yet at last, in the following
passage, we find the critic's finger distinctly laid on the
doctrine which he proposes to identify with the Apostle's
"knowing Christ according to the flesh."</p>

<p>"That such a change" (in the Apostle's teaching) "is
capable of being traced, has been already intimated. Both
Epistles to the Thessalonians, with the exception of a few
practical precepts, are the expansion and repetition of a single
thought,&mdash;'the coming of Christ.' It was the absorbing
thought of the Apostle and his converts, quickened in both by
the persecutions which they had suffered. Not that with this
expectation of Christ's kingdom there mingled any vision of
a temporal rule over the kingdoms of the earth. That was
far from the Apostle. But there was that in it which fell
short of the more perfect truth. It was not, 'The kingdom of
God is within you'; but, 'Lo here, and lo there.' It was defined
by time, and was to take place within the Apostle's own
life. The images in which it clothed itself were traditional
among the Jews; they were outward and visible, liable to the
misconstruction of the enemies of the faith, and to the misapprehension
of the first converts,&mdash;imperfectly, as the Apostle
saw afterwards, conveying the inward and spiritual meaning.
The kingdom which they described was not eternal and
heavenly, but very near and present, ready to burst forth
everywhere, and by its very nearness in point of time seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
to touch our actual human state. Afterwards the kingdom
of God appeared to remove itself within, to withdraw into the
unseen world. The earthen vessel must be broken first, the
unbeliever unclothed that he might be clothed upon, that
mortality may be swallowed up of life. He was no longer
'waiting for the Son from heaven'; but 'desirous to depart
and be with Christ' (Phil. i. 23). Such is the change, not
so much in the Apostle's belief as in his mode of conception;
a change natural to the human mind itself, and above all to
the Jewish mind; a change which, after it had taken place,
left the vestiges of the prior state in the Montanism of the
second century, which may not improperly be regarded as the
spirit of the first century overliving itself. Old things had
passed away, and, behold, all things became new. And yet
the former things&mdash;the material vision of Christ's kingdom&mdash;have
ever been prone to return; not only in the first and
second century, but in every age of enthusiasm, men have
been apt to walk by sight and not by faith. In the hour of
trouble and perplexity, when darkness spreads itself over the
earth, and Antichrist is already come, they have lifted up
their eyes to the heavens, looking for the sign of the Son of
man."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 10.</p>

<p>If to announce the coming of Christ is to "know him according
to the flesh," St. Paul assuredly did not keep his
resolve "henceforth to know him no more." For the expectation
reappears, without any perceptible change, in his later
Epistles; as in Rom. xiii. 11, 12: "Do this the rather, knowing
the time,&mdash;that now is the time to awake out of sleep:
for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed:
the night is far spent; the day is at hand";&mdash;and in Phil. iv.
5: "The Lord is at hand."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Moreover, it is utterly impossible
that <i>this</i> element of his teaching could be adduced in
proof of his "preaching circumcision." It had nothing to do
with the question of Jew and Gentile; with the most opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
solutions of which it is equally compatible.</p>

<p>In truth, our author has here combined two passages,
which throw no light on one another, and has extracted from
each what neither is able to yield. The words (in Gal. v. 11)
"if I <i>still</i> preach circumcision," do not really imply that the
Apostle once <i>did</i> so preach; though in an accurate writer
this sense might be insisted on. He is not thinking of <i>his
own</i> former notions, but of <i>other people's</i>, continuing unaltered
after they ought to have changed. There <i>were</i> persons who,
in spite of the dispensation of the Spirit, <i>still</i> preached circumcision
after its significance was gone. This did not Paul;
but he was charged with doing so: and he says, "Well, if so,
I am a Judaizer like you, and I cannot be <i>also</i> chargeable
with teaching that the cross of Christ supersedes the Law."
The true sense is, therefore, given by the rendering, "If I
preach circumcision <i>still</i>,"&mdash;that is, as <i>still necessary</i>; and
no tale is told of the Apostle's earlier teaching.</p>

<p>The other passage (2 Cor. v. 16) <i>does</i> undoubtedly refer
to a former state of the writer's own mind, when he "recognized
Christ according to the flesh." But he alludes, we
apprehend, to the period when he was a "Hebrew of the
Hebrews"; and had no conception as yet of a suffering,
dying, and heavenly Christ;&mdash;when he was full of the
thoughts still occupying the twelve, who did not take in the
significance of the cross, but carried past it their old Messianic
notions. "There may have been a time," he means to
say, "when I thought only of a national, Israelitish, historical
Messiah, bound by the law of his fathers, and binding
to it. Had this been the true conception of him, then would
it have been a matter of privilege and pride to be near his
person, to stand in natural relations with him, and be mixed
up with the incidents of his local career. But ever since I
understood the cross, and saw that Messiah's life began in
death, a far other truth has dawned upon me. When he
gave up the ghost, all the accidents of his humanity&mdash;his
lineage, his nationality, his earthly manifestation&mdash;were left
behind and died away; and they must carry with them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
extinction whatever feelings had collected round them,&mdash;family
pride, Jewish exclusiveness, and the memories of personal
companionship. From that moment, clear of earthly
entanglements, Christ in the spirit draws to him a community
of human spirits,&mdash;one with him in self-abnegation, dying to
the earthly past; one with him in re-birth, living to heavenly
union with God. Thus, if any one be in Christ, it amounts
to a new creation; his old self has passed away; behold, all
things have become new." The Apostle, therefore, sets up
the death of Christ, as cutting off, for all disciples, the prior
time from the subsequent; as flinging the former, with all
the human conceptions that cling to it, into eclipse and annihilation,
and beginning a new and luminous existence in the
latter; as breaking the very identity of the believer, and delivering
him from the thraldom of nature into the freedom of
the Spirit. The cross had already done its work ere St.
Paul became a disciple. He had never known his Lord but
in the spirit; and the "Christ," whom he had "known according
to the flesh," was the Jewish Messiah of his previous
and unconverted conception. Mr. Stanley's objection, that
the Apostle could hardly have spoken of his unconverted
state without stronger condemnation, might perhaps hold,
were the allusions to his fit of persecuting violence against
the Church. But there was no occasion for self-reproach in
describing the picture of a national Messiah, on which, in
common with his countrymen, he had permitted his imagination
to dwell.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>
<p>Neither, then, from his own direct assertion, nor from comparison
of his several writings, <i>inter se</i>, do we learn anything
of the alleged <i>development</i> of the Apostle's doctrine. There
is no element in it, that, from inability to co-exist with the
rest, requires to be assigned to a date of its own. The breach
with Judaism, especially, we conceive to have been complete
from the first, and unsusceptible of degrees; nay, to have
been the initial principle of his conversion, the secretly prepared
condition or tendency of mind that rendered him accessible
to the Divine call, and open to sudden change in the
direction of his character. When first released from the
formulas of a Jewish Christology, and communing in spirit
with a heavenly and universal Lord, his mind would doubtless
be met by a multitude of new problems, and would work
freely towards their resolution, with the quickening consciousness
of new light streaming in, and a grander landscape of
Providence opening before him. The very intensity of this
inward action, however,&mdash;the thirst it sustains for its own
completion,&mdash;forbids us to attribute to it a life-long duration;
ere fifteen years were passed, its force would be spent by
having realized its work, and attained the equilibrium of a
holy peace. Whatever subsequent changes occurred would
be of a different nature, enforced by the turn of the world's
affairs; a mere remoulding or reproportioning of inward
faiths, in adaptation to the altered pressures of the hour. Of
such modifications, such retreat towards the background of
once favorite ideas, and advance of dim suggestions into strong
light, there are doubtless examples in St. Paul. The expectation
of Christ's speedy coming to close the world's affairs,
and realize "the kingdom," could not but dominate at first,
and pale every other interest and belief by the terror and
glory of its light. But there is a limit beyond which the
strain of longing cannot be sustained; as it subsides, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
present and actual recovers power, and pushes its problems
forward, and gains once more the eye that had looked beyond
them. And so, after a while, spring up questions of Christian
order that will not bear to be put off;&mdash;how to live in a
world that, however near its doom, entangles the disciple still
in a web of difficult relations; how to touch the skirt of its
idolatries, and not be tainted; how to behave to wife and
child in this last generation of human affairs; how to seal up
the passions that <i>ought to die</i> within the saints, but were not
dead; how to prevent the gifts of the Spirit from overbalancing
themselves, on the heights of a dizzied mind, into outrages
on nature; how to preserve to the woman and the slave,
in their exulting reaction from degraded life, the sense of
modest reverence, and the appreciation of faithful service.
Day by day questions of this kind insisted on attention, and
brought out a fresh type of sentiments proper for their determination,
and offering to view a new side of the Christian
thought and life. Nor, again, could many years elapse, before
the Jew and Gentile difficulty changed its whole aspect,
and expanded, from a petty scruple compromised at Jerusalem,
into a world-wide theology, regulative of all future history.
When it became evident that it was no question about a
small sprinkling of ethnic converts,&mdash;mere hangers-on of
Hebrew families and synagogues; when the delay of Messiah,
and the energy of Paul, gave occasion for thousands to pour
in; when it seemed imminent that Palestine should be outvoted
and overpowered by the growth of the foreign Gospel,
the alarm of the Judaic Christians became great. They
tracked Paul's steps; their emissaries were everywhere;
their arguments and doctrine became more constricted, and
his more wide and free; and as the clouds visibly lowered
over Israel, touching him as well as them with gloom, all the
more did he see the sunshine flood the lands beyond; and his
national trust assumed this form,&mdash;that, maybe, the outlying
heavenly light may creep back as the dark hour passes, and
again set the shadows moving on the hills it has so long glorified.
The Apostle died before the question settled itself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the mere force of the facts,&mdash;by the utter breaking up of the
Jewish nation, and the inpouring Gentile numbers. Others
waited to be driven into catholicity by events; it is his glory
to have surrendered himself to the inspiration that implanted
in him its principle from the first. He lived, however, to see
a mighty growth, though not the final fruit; and the grand
scale on which he conducts the controversy, in his Epistle to
the Romans, by converging reasonings fetched from afar out
of history, and aloft out of the perfections of God, and deep
out of human nature, shows how his thought expands with
the exigencies of experience, and advances to fill the whole
greatness of his opportunities.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the earliest Apostolic Christianity
consisted mainly in the faith of Christ's coming again,
"to-day, or to-morrow, or the third day." This event, with
its effect on the living, was <i>the one only point</i>, Mr. Stanley
conceives, on which St. Paul, in his great chapter on the Resurrection,
professed to have a distinct revelation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On one point only he professes to have a distinct revelation,
and that not with regard to the dead, but to the living.
So firmly was the first generation of Christians possessed of
the belief that they should live to see the second coming, that
it is here assumed as a matter of course; and their fate, as
near and immediate, is used to illustrate the darker and more
mysterious subject of the fate of those already dead. That
vision of 'the last man,' which now seems so remote as to live
only in poetic fiction, was to the Apostle an awful reality;
but it is brought forward only to express the certainty that,
even here, a change must take place, the greatest that imagination
can conceive."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 398.</p>

<p>That this belief, where held at all, should be paramount
and absorbing, follows from its very nature. Accordingly,
St. Paul, as Mr. Jowett remarks, makes even the essence of
the Gospel to consist in it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appears remarkable, that St. Paul should make the
essence of the Gospel consist, not in the belief in Christ, or
in taking up the cross of Christ, but in the hope of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
coming again. Such, however, was the faith of the Thessalonian
Church; such is the tone and spirit of the Epistle.
Neither in the Apostolic times, nor in our own, can we reduce
all to the same type. One aspect of the Gospel is more
outward, another more inward; one seems to connect with the
life of Christ, another with his death; one with his birth into
the world, another with his coming again. If we will not
insist on determining the times and the seasons, or on knowing
the manner how, all these different ways may lead us
within the veil. The faith of modern times embraces many
parts and truths; yet we allow men, according to their individual
character, to dwell on this truth or that, as more peculiarly
appropriate to their nature. The faith of the early
Church was simpler and more progressive, pausing in the
same way on a particular truth, which the circumstances of
the world or the Church brought before them."&mdash;Vol. I.
p. 46.</p>

<p>Only it is not on "a particular <i>truth</i>," but on a particular
<i>error</i>, that the "pause" of faith was here made;&mdash;an error
found or implied, as our author observes, "in almost every
book of the New Testament; in the discourses of our Lord
himself, as well as in the Acts of the Apostles; in the Epistles
of St. Paul, no less than in the Book of the Revelation."
Mr. Jowett does not evade the difficulty. In an admirable
essay on this special subject, he frankly states the facts, traces
their influence on the early Church, accepts them as among
the limits which human conditions impose on Divine revelation,
and shows from them, how, even in God's highest teachings,
he leaves much truth to be drawn forth from time and
experience.</p>

<p>"It is a subject," he says, "from which the interpreter of
Scripture would gladly turn aside. For it seems as if he
were compelled to say at the outset, 'that St. Paul was mistaken,
and that in support of his mistake he could appeal to
the words of Christ himself.' Nothing can be plainer than
the meaning of those words, and yet they seem to be contradicted
by the very fact, that, after eighteen centuries, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
world is as it was. In the words which are attributed, in the
Epistle of St. Peter, to the unbelievers of that day, we might
truly say that, since the fathers have fallen asleep, all things
remain the same from the beginning. Not only do 'all things
remain the same,' but the very belief itself (in the sense in
which it was held by the first Christians) has been ready to
vanish away."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 96.</p>

<p>It is the infirmity of human nature&mdash;an infirmity irremovable
by inspiration&mdash;to translate eternal truth into forms of
time, to throw color into the invisible till it can be seen, and
look into any given infinity till finite shapes appear within it,
and it is felt as infinite no more. The soul tries, as it were,
every apparent path, from spiritual apprehension to scientific
knowledge, from deep insight to clear foresight, from perception
of what God <i>is</i> to vaticination of what he <i>does</i>; and abides
alone with the Holy Presence, that will not tell His counsels,
but is ever there himself. From the world of Divine
reality into that of transient phenomena, there is no bridge
found as yet; and only He, whose footsteps need no ground,
can pass across. We know somewhat on both sides; but the
chasm between vindicates its perpetuity against all invasion.
<i>Vision</i> for faith; <i>prevision</i> for science:&mdash;this seems to be
the inviolable allotment of gifts by the Father of lights. And
whoever overlooks this rule, and, inspired with discernment
of what absolutely is, ventures to pronounce what relatively
will be, embodies his truth in a form whence it must again
be disengaged. The deepest spiritual insight is ineffectual
to teach <i>past</i> history; it is equally so to teach <i>future</i> history.
The moment you lose sight of this fact, and expect the sons
of God to <i>predict</i> for you, you confound inspiration with
divination, and will pay the double penalty of missing the
truth they have, and being disappointed at that which they
have not. It is not always much otherwise with themselves;
the light which they <i>are</i>, they do not <i>see</i>; and that which
shapes itself before them, and becomes the <i>object</i> of their
minds, is but the shadow of human things, deepened and
sharpened, perhaps also misplaced, by the preternatural intensity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
By its very inwardness and closeness to the soul's
centre, God's Spirit may express itself chiefly in the unconscious
attitudes and manifestations of the mind; especially as it
is these that often leave the most ineffaceable impressions of
character upon others, and may, therefore, be the vehicle of
a more life-giving power than any purposed teaching or more
conscious authority. The disappointment of an avowed prediction,
or the error of an elaborated doctrine, no more affects
the Divine inspiration at the heart of Christianity, than the
miscalculations and failure of the Crusades disprove their
Providential function in the historical education of mankind.
Mr. Jowett takes up the question from another side, and
shows how the faith in a future life, though not directly <i>given</i>,
necessarily disengaged itself in the end from the expectation
of the coming of Christ.</p>

<p>"We naturally ask, why a future life, as distinct from this,
was not made a part of the first preaching of the Gospel?&mdash;why,
in other words, the faith of the first Christians did not
exactly coincide with our own? There are many ways in
which the answer to this question may be expressed. The
philosopher will say, that the difference in the mode of
thought of that age and our own rendered it impossible,
humanly speaking, that the veil of sense should be altogether
removed. The theologian will admit that Providence does
not teach men that which they can teach themselves. While
there are lessons which it immediately communicates, there is
much which it leaves to be drawn forth by time and events.
Experience may often enlarge faith; it may also correct it.
No one can doubt that the faith and practice of the early
Church, respecting the admission of the Gentiles, were greatly
altered by the fact that the Gentiles themselves flocked in;
'the kingdom of heaven suffered violence, and the violent
took it by force.' In like manner, the faith respecting the
coming of Christ was modified by the continuance of the
world itself. Common sense suggests that those who were
in the first ecstasy of conversion, and those who after the
lapse of years saw the world unchanged and the fabric of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Church on earth rising around them, could not regard the
day of the Lord with the same feeling. While to the one
it seemed near and present, at any moment ready to burst
forth, to the other it was a long way off, separated by time,
and as it were by place, a world beyond the stars, yet, strangely
enough, also having its dwelling in the heart of man, as it
were the atmosphere in which he lived, the mental world by
which he was surrounded. Not at once, but gradually, did
the cloud clear up, and the one mode of faith take the place
of the other. Apart from the prophets, though then beyond
them, springing up in a new and living way in the soul of
man, corrected by long experience, as the 'fathers one by one
fell asleep,' as the hopes of the Jewish race declined, as ecstatic
gifts ceased, as a regular hierarchy was established
in the Church, the belief in the coming of Christ was transformed
from being outward to becoming inward, from being
national to becoming individual and universal,&mdash;from being
Jewish to becoming Christian."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 99.</p>

<p>With the Apostle Paul, however, the "coming of Christ"
occupies the place of our "future life"; the <i>living</i> mass of
disciples, waiting till then for the "redemption of their
bodies," fill the foreground and largest space in the scene;
the rising of the dead is the subsidiary fact, needful to the
completeness of the gift of life in Christ. On this crisis, supposed
to be so near, his eye was exclusively fixed whenever
he spoke of the Christian's "salvation"; and could he have
been told that no such crisis would come, that, for fifty generations,
the present order of the world would vindicate its
stability, we cannot imagine what shape his faith would have
assumed; whether he would have made light of all these
centuries, said that with the Eternal "a thousand years are
but as one day," and still opposed to one another the αιων
ουτος and the αιων μελλων; or whether he would have found
that the distinction was evanescent, and the kingdom of God
was to be not sent hither, but to be created here; or how, in
either case, he would have represented to himself the state of
the innumerable dead. These are questions which did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
arise for him; and it were vain to conjecture his solution.
He is engaged with other problems;&mdash;all, indeed, having
reference to that never doubted crisis, and arising out of its
manifold relations, yet so treated by him as to detach them
unawares from their origin, and give them a permanent place
in the religious consciousness of men. <i>Who</i> were to be the
subjects of that salvation? How were they <i>qualified</i>? By
what act of God's, and what temper of their own, to reach
the blessing? What present <i>assurance</i> had they of this approaching
good? It is in dealing with these questions that
St. Paul darts from his objective theology into the deepest
recesses of human experience, and fetches into expression
spiritual truths that transcend their incidental occasion, and
will remain valid while there is a soul in man.</p>

<p>In the Apostle's habit of thought there is a certain antique
<i>realism</i> which renders many of his doctrines and reasonings
almost unpresentable before a modern imagination. With
our sharp notions of personality, of the entire insulation of
each mind as an individual entity, of the antithesis of inner
self to the outer everything, we are quite out of St. Paul's
latitude, and shall be perpetually taking for figures and personification
what had a literal earnestness for him. The universe
is with him full of Agents that for us are only Attributes,&mdash;the
theatre of certain <i>real</i> principles (<i>i. e.</i> principles
having existence independent of us), that carry out their tendencies
and history among themselves, and upon and through
individual men, as organs or media of their activity. Thus,
<i>Sin</i> is neither the mere voluntary unfaithfulness of the transgressor,
nor the person of the tempter; but <i>both</i> of these;
and that not apart from one another or alternately, but blended
together under the conception of a universal element of
evil, having its objective focus in Satan and its subjective
manifestation in man. In like manner its opposite, <i>Righteousness</i>
(Justification), is not exclusively human rectitude, or the
Divine justice, or <i>quasi</i>-goodness substituted for genuine; but
less ethical than the first, less forensic than the last, and more
ontological than either; that element, we may say, in the essence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
of God which sets man at one with Him, and is the
common ground of their harmonious relation. Around these
two contrasted principles, others, equally conceived as real
elements, and misunderstood as mere attributes or phenomena,
group themselves on either side. With the former is
<i>Death</i>,&mdash;the pair being <i>gemini</i>, not simply joined by decree
of God in time, but inseparable <i>in rerum natura</i>, co-ordinates
by physical necessity; and <i>Flesh</i>, the material or medium
that furnishes the endowments of sense, and instinct, and
the natural will, and affords to Sin its seat and hold upon
us; and <i>Law</i>, the discriminating light that parts the mixture
of good and evil, and, on entering into us, brings the slumbering
evil into the conscious state, and so makes it sin relatively
to us, and simultaneously shows us the good without adding
to the force for producing it. With the latter&mdash;Righteousness&mdash;are
enjoined <i>Life</i>, the positive opposite of Death, and,
like it, a function of the moral as well as the natural constitution,
the immortal energy inherent in sinless being; and
<i>Spirit</i>, the absolute essence of God, present as the vivifying
source of whatever transcends nature,&mdash;a faint susceptibility,
felt only to be overmastered, in the sons of Adam,&mdash;a conquering
power, coalescing with the personality itself, in Christ
and his disciples,&mdash;and a spontaneous flow of higher life
seizing on converted men as organs of its charismata; and
<i>Faith</i>,&mdash;the opposite of Law,&mdash;the passing out of ourselves
to embrace unseen relations, to make conscious appropriation
of the Spirit, and thus enter into union with Christ and God.
Even this most subjective of all the great principles of the
Apostle's theology, is more than a mere private and personal
act. As common to all the disciples,&mdash;the simultaneous gaze
that connects them as a whole with Christ,&mdash;its single threads
pass out and become a converging web. As something other
than the act (of obedience) which men were under bond to
render, it is a new institute of God, and, relatively to them,
reads itself off as <i>Grace</i>. As opposed to Law, in which there
is a delivery of the Divine will <i>into</i> men, it involves a <i>drawing</i>
by Divine love of an affection <i>out of</i> men. And under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
all these aspects it acquires something of that indeterminate
character, subjective and objective at once, which the associated
elements possess in a much higher degree. The same
mode of thought is traceable in another form. The Apostle
exhibits the providential scheme of the human race by distributing
them into two successive <i>gentes</i>,&mdash;the earthy or natural,
the heavenly or spiritual; and lays down all the predicates
of each direct from the personal history of their respective
heads, Adam and Christ. Whatever is true of the
founder is considered as known of the followers; the phenomena
of his being spread themselves inclusively to theirs.
He is regarded, not simply as a representative individual,
while they are the represented individuals; but as a <i>type</i> of
being within which they are contained, and which in its history
and vicissitudes carries them hither and thither. Condemnation
and redemption take place by <i>Kinds</i>, and fall on
particular persons in virtue of their partaking of these kinds.
Settle the attributes of the species, as found in its archetype,
and you know what to say of individuals. It is not difficult
to understand this way of thinking so long as the Apostle
applies it, as a naturalist might, to the <i>Adamic gens</i>; and
argues, that, being made of earthy materials (χοικοι), and
having the focus of personality in σαρξ, with no adequate
counterpoise of πνευμα, it is the seat of sin and death. But
it is less easy to follow the Apostle's meaning when he similarly
identifies Christians with Christ, and transfers, or rather
extends, to them all the great characteristics of his existence.
They are crucified to the world. They are "all <i>dead</i>" with
him; they are "buried with him" in baptism; they are "risen
with him"; their "life is hid with him in God." And
while this is true of <i>living</i> disciples, he is no less "the first-fruits
of them that sleep"; his resurrection is but the first
pulsation of an act that next proceeds to theirs, and then completes
the transformation of the living. All this is meant for
more than rhetorical analogy. With Christ, and in Christ,
took place a re-constitution of humanity. Of the new man,
he was the ideal and archetype; inverting the proportions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
σαρξ and πνευμα, and having his essence and personality in the
latter, so as to render sin an unrealized possibility and death
a transitory accident. The spirit in him which evinced its
life-giving power in raising him from the dead, is no more
limited to his individuality, than flesh and blood were the
attributes of Adam only. It spreads to the whole family of
souls, springing up into his kindred; it flows into them as
they look up to him in faith, and are reborn to him; it repeats
in them the fruits it produced in him,&mdash;the sacrifice of self,&mdash;the
dying away of passion and pride,&mdash;the heavenly love
that darts upon the wing whither the bleeding feet of conscience
fail to climb,&mdash;together with many "a gift less excellent,"
of healing and of tongues. The consciousness of
this new heart, set free with Divine affections, is immediate
evidence of their union with Christ, of the Real Presence of
his Spirit within them, of their substantive incorporation into
his essence, and therefore of a restored harmony and even
oneness with God. To what extent the Apostle conceived
that this transformation of nature, by partnership in the properties
of the heavenly Christ, might be carried in the living
disciple, it is not possible to say. It amounted to "a new
creation"; and among the "old things" that had already
"passed away," he probably included more than the moral
habits and feelings of the unconverted state; and conceived
that the same spirit by which these died out was purifying
also the bodily organism of the believer, and leavening it
with antiseptic preparation for its final investiture with immortality.
That last "change," like the resurrection itself,
is not regarded as an external miracle, suddenly forced on an
uncongenial material by mere Almightiness; but as the last
and crowning stage of an internal development, whose principle
had long been active,&mdash;the emergence from all entanglement
with "flesh and blood" of that spiritual element which
in Jesus "could not be holden of death," and which, dwelling
in his disciples, already deadened and damped the vitality of
the σαρξ, and would at last quicken the σωμα with imperishable
life. Thus it is that "Christ" is not to St. Paul an historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
individual, but a generic nature,&mdash;the archetype of a
spiritual species, sharing his attributes and repeating his experience.</p>

<p>Cleared as a stage for these contending principles, the universe
witnesses their co-existence and antagonism from the
beginning to the end of time.</p>

<p>The great drama has two main acts, and the cross of Christ
divides them.</p>

<p>The first is a descending period, accumulating the force of
evil to a pitch of frightful triumph. The second is an ascending
period, at whose goal the last enemy is gone.</p>

<p>In the opening scene of the first, extending from Adam to
Moses, both Flesh and Spirit were there; not yet, however,
in conflict; but the latter sleeping as a mere susceptibility,
and the former having its own way in the instinctive life of
man. The state was not one which, had the comparison been
made, would have accorded with the Divine will. It was
therefore really, though unconsciously, a reign of Sin, as was
proved by the presence of Sin's inseparable sign,&mdash;the generations
<i>died</i>.</p>

<p>The next scene was marked by the introduction of <i>Law</i>.
The effects were, to bring into full consciousness the sin before
unmarked, and so make it exceedingly sinful; to set man
at variance with himself by giving him discernment, and
quickening his longing and his fear, without any new spring
of force; and actually to multiply transgressions by enumerating
and suggesting them.</p>

<p>Hence, at the close of the period, an utter rotting away of
human society, and a confirmed moral incapacity of the
widest sweep. The spontaneous law of nature and the written
law of Moses being equally set at naught by Gentile and
by Jew, any promises God might have given fell through,
from human breach of the conditions. This was the moment
seized for instituting a new creation; the promised Messiah
of the Jews being the vehicle of its accomplishment, and the
link of connection between the old and the new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>All the Messianic conditions were <i>fulfilled</i>,&mdash;the right
tribe, the right family, the right personal marks and characteristics.
But they were also <i>transcended</i>. Along with the
human infirmities and liabilities was present, in this archetype
of a new race, the Spirit in such full measure as to
constitute his proper self, or at least win that centre by complete
victory over nature and temptation and surrender of all
he had and was to a Divine Love. As he had baffled and
held off Sin, Death had so far no business with him. Yet
what was to be done? for there were conflicting claims upon
him. Sinless in himself, he was of a sin-doomed type, the
<i>likeness</i> of sinful flesh (ὁμοιωμα σαρκος ἁμαρτιας), and therefore
liable to the incidents of such a race. This was at least his
property by nature. At the same time, he was internally
and essentially of the opposite type; the image of God (εικων
του Θεου), and so, foreign to the mortal fate, at once imperishable
and life-giving. In the person of this double nature, the
contest between the antagonists must come to an issue; and
while <i>both</i> gain their due, it is the last triumph of evil, the
first opening of eternal good. Sin, recognizing in his suffering
and mortal frame its own physical counterpart and
shadow, strikes him with death, exerting for that end its own
"strength" and instrument, "the Law." But in thus carrying
its course upon the guiltless, it overreached and spent
itself; and the Law, lending itself to such an act, fell into
self-contradiction, and disappeared in suicide. He died,
therefore, in virtue of what was really foreign to him, as
<i>representative</i> of a Sin which was not his, but which yet involved
him, as human, in sorrow and mortality. But no
sooner had this happened, than his "Righteousness" vindicated
its power. He came out of death, which <i>could not keep</i>
one so holy; and now, escaped from nationality, and placed
aloft as the ideal of the new humanity, his vivifying spirit
penetrates the heart of men below, and, taking them on the
side of faith and love instead of will, kindles a divine fire
that burns up the dead elements of the "old man," and
wraps the "heavenly places" and the earthly in a common
blaze. By spiritual affiliation with him, his disciples enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
the essence of all holy and immortal natures. And so it
comes to pass, that, through the incidence of sorrow and death
in the wrong place, an objective power of "righteousness" is
set free, that reconciles mankind with God, and restores them
to sanctity and life. The past and the future of humanity
were concentrated, just at the turning point between them, in
one person; the natural element, bearing the burden of the
past, perished and fell away; the spiritual and divine principle,
containing the germ of the future, asserted its inextinguishable
life; and from heaven evinced its self-multiplying
power, making him only "the first-born of many brethren."</p>

<p>Thus was the second act initiated, which also presented
two successive scenes. During the first, the Christ was still
in heaven; and his Spirit on earth, having the community of
disciples for its organ or "body," stood in presence still of the
opposing powers. In the world, it encroached upon the
province of evil continually, and reclaimed a citadel here and
there. In the Church, if it infused as yet no <i>perfect</i> grace,
it left its "earnest" everywhere;&mdash;ecstatic gifts and mystic
insights; hearts set free from pride and scorn, and brought
to the meekness and gentleness of Christ; the self-seeking
will surrendered; the anxious conscience led to trust; the
tangles of thought smoothed out by a wisdom not its own;
and outward distinctions reduced to naught by faith, and
hope, and charity. Nevertheless, Satan disturbed the κοσμος
still; and even the children of the Spirit were but prisoners
yet, and felt the tent of nature but a poor abode. They had
yet to wait for their full adoption; when the tabernacle in
which they groaned being dissolved, they should be invested
with an unwasting frame.</p>

<p>This was reserved for the final scene, the coming and the
reign of Christ. At this culminating crisis, the antagonism
which in Adam was as yet unfelt from the ascendency of
nature, was to die out and cease on the absolute triumph of
the Spirit. Physically, death was to disappear; the departed
being finally reinstated in life, and the living "clothed upon"
with their new garment ere yet they were stripped of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
old. Morally, the remnant of inner strife and temptation,
that even the faith of saints might leave unappeased, would
pass away, aspiration be harmonized with achieving power,
and in conscious presence of the objects of deepest affection
and reverence the sighs of separation would cease. As soon
as resistance was over, and there was nothing to subdue, the
separate function of God's redeeming and sanctifying Spirit
would find no work; "the kingdom would be resigned to the
Father"; "the Son would be subject"; and "the Trinity
would cease."</p>

<p>Whether the Apostle's vision of trust was really of universal
success, and included even those who should still be found
astray at last, is a question difficult of direct determination;
but not very doubtful when tried by the general scope of his
doctrine. Mr. Jowett's judgment, given in the following passage,
truly seizes, we think, the feeling of St. Paul. The
author is commenting on the parallel drawn between Adam
and Christ, especially on the words, "As by one man's transgression
sin entered into the world, and death by sin," and has
shown that they do <i>not</i> teach any imputation of Adam's sin.</p>

<p>"It is hardly necessary to ask the further question, what
meaning we can attach to the imputation of sin and guilt
which are not our own, and of which we are unconscious.
God can never see us other than we really are, or judge us
without reference to all our circumstances and antecedents.
If we can hardly suppose that he would allow a fiction of
mercy to be interposed between ourselves and him, still less
can we imagine that he would interpose a fiction of vengeance.
If he requires holiness before he will save, much
more, may we say in the Apostle's form of speech, will he
require sin before he dooms us to perdition. Nor can anything
be in spirit more contrary to the living consciousness
of sin of which the Apostle everywhere speaks, than the
conception of sin as dead, unconscious evil, originating in the
act of an individual man, in the world before the flood.</p>

<p>"On the whole, then, we are led to infer that in the Augustinian
interpretation of this passage, even if it agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
the letter of the text, too little regard has been paid to the
extent to which St. Paul uses figurative language, and to the
manner of his age in interpretations of the Old Testament.
The difficulty of supposing him to be allegorizing the narrative
of Genesis is slight, in comparison with the difficulty of supposing
him to countenance a doctrine at variance with our
first notions of the moral nature of God.</p>

<p>"But when the figure is dropped, and allowance is made
for the manner of the age, the question once more returns
upon us,&mdash;'What is the Apostle's meaning?' He is arguing,
we see, κατ ανθρωπον, and taking his stand on the received
opinions of his time. Do we imagine that his object is no
other than to set the seal of his authority on these traditional
beliefs? The whole analogy, not merely of the writings of
St. Paul, but of the entire New Testament, would lead us to
suppose that his object was not to reassert them, but to teach,
through them, a new and nobler lesson. The Jewish Rabbis
would have spoken of the first and second Adam; but which
of them would have made the application of the figure to all
mankind? A figure of speech it remains still, an allegory
after the manner of that age and country, but yet with no
uncertain or ambiguous interpretation. It means that 'God
hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth'; that
'he hath concluded all under sin, that he may have mercy
upon all'; that life answers to death, the times before to the
times after the revelation of Jesus Christ. It means that we
are one in a common sinful nature, which, even if it be not
derived from the sin of Adam, exists as really as if it were.
It means that we shall be made one in Christ by the grace
of God, in a measure here, more fully and perfectly in another
world. More than this it also means, and more than language
can express, but not the weak and beggarly elements
of Rabbinical tradition. We may not encumber St. Paul
with the things which he 'destroyed.' What it means further
is not to be attained by theological distinctions, but by putting
off the old man and putting on the new man."&mdash;Vol. II. p. 166.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>On surveying the picture of time and the history of humanity
that lay beneath St. Paul's eye, the question naturally
arises, What is its significance and value for us? Manifestly
not those of an absolute guide through the labyrinthine depths
of the Divine counsels. "We can scarcely imagine what
would have been the feeling of St. Paul, could he have foreseen
that later ages would look not to the faith of Abraham
in the Law, but to the Epistle to the Romans, as the highest
authority on the doctrine of justification by faith; or, that they
would have regarded the allegory of Hagar and Sarah, in the
Galatians, as a difficulty to be resolved by the inspiration of
the Apostle."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> We cannot say of him less than Mr. Jowett
says of a greater than Paul, that in many places "his teaching
is on a level with the modes of thought of his age." (I. 97.)
The ultimate point towards which all the lines of his expectations
converged, and all the history of the past appeared to
gaze, we know to have had no existence where he placed it;
and as the whole scheme was laid out to lead up to this, it
might seem to disappear as the fabric of a dream. Yet it is
not so; and the very fear implies that we look in the wrong
place for the permanent amid the evanescent in the Gospel.
Religion&mdash;revealed or unrevealed&mdash;is no production of
the systematizing intellect,&mdash;inspired or uninspired. The
workings of constructive thought follow, not lead it. Their
function is not creative, but simply adaptive;&mdash;to find a settlement
and orderly method of being and growing for some new
principle of divine life, or for some old principle in an altered
scene; to ward off from it uncongenial elements, remove
dead matter that chokes it, and surround it with conditions
whence it may weave its organism around it and send deep
roots into the mellowed soil of humanity. Divine truth is
the coming of God to man, pathless and traceless: theologic
thought is the retrogressive search of man after God, not by
"<i>His</i> ways which are past finding out," and invisible as
night, but necessarily by such tracks as the age has opened
and another age may close or change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>The manifestation of supernatural realities to the human
soul involves so much which is mysterious and unique, that
only under great qualification can we compare it with the
known mental processes. But were we to conceive of it less
by the analogy of scientific discovery, and more by that of
artistic apprehension, many an embarrassment would be
saved. In a work of high art, you give a Phidias or a Raffaelle
<i>his subject</i>; he necessarily takes it from that which
stirs the heart of his time, and has a solemnity for his own
and you do not find fault that there is mythology in the
group, or Mariolatry in the picture. Through the conceptions
of one time there speaks a feeling for all; and the representation
may be immortal, when the thing represented
has long been historical. Nor is it that it only reflects
honor on its author's name. It springs from an inner harmony
with the very heart of things, and it gives a new
expressiveness to life and nature, and leaves behind a self-luminous
spot in the world, where there was "gross darkness"
before. Hence it looks into the eyes, and finds the
soul of one generation after another; and, amid the change
of materials and the succession of schools, keeps alive the
very sense by which alone "materials" can be wielded and
"schools" exist. With just the same result do the accidental
and temporary media fall away from early Christianity; disengaging
a residuary spirit that takes up the life of all times,
touches a consciousness else unreached, and breathes upon
the face of things, till the meanings writ there with invisible
ink come into clearness before the eye. If it pleases God,
instead of spreading at our feet the things to be seen, rather
to quicken our vision till we see them where they are, it is
revelation all the same, only deeper and more various; not
an incident of position, but a power that can migrate in place
and time, and read the Providential perspective everywhere.
This profounder insight into divine relations it has been the
especial office of St. Paul to awaken; and none the less that
the flashes by which he gives it are incidental, and do not
proceed from the Rabbinic lamp which he holds up to his
apocalyptic pictures. Indeed, it is he, in great measure, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
has carried Christendom into regions other than his own.
His thought is everywhere penetrated with an intense heat,
leavened with lightning, that fuses the mass containing it,
and runs off alive for other media to hold it. The revelation
to him of Christ in heaven set in action all the resources of
his nature, and gave them a preternatural tension. The
sentiments which found satisfaction, the intimations which
came into expression, in his form of doctrine, are now for
ever <i>human</i>, fixed in the self-knowledge of men by his faithful
words, and sure to transmigrate into other forms, when
their first embodiment will hold them no more. And so much
is the Apostle's later exposition of his hope divested of what
is special to himself, that to all ages since it has struck upon
the ear of mourners along with the very toll of the funeral
bell; and though often indistinct to their mind, it has jarred
with no falsehood on their heart, but sounded like an anthem
in the dark,&mdash;great music and dim words. It needed only
time and events to transmute the doctrine into that of a future
life. For it included&mdash;in order to meet the case of those
who had "fallen asleep"&mdash;the conception of a path, through
death before the time, "to depart and be with Christ"; only
that this was the minor provision, the by-path of the early
few. Reopened, however, as it always was when a disciple
passed away, it became an evermore familiar track; and experience
had but to negative the opposite direction by leaving
it untraced, in order that the upward track should become the
<i>via sacra</i> of human faith. And can any one doubt what the
justification by faith means, when construed into the language
of universal experience? It means that God wants more
from us, and also less, than the anxious will can do; more,
because he wants ourselves; less, because he does not want
our niceties of work. It means that we are called to spiritual
heights we strive in vain to climb; that the most patient feet,
step after step upon the ground, will but stand upon the
earthly mountains after all; and it is the fiery chariot of love
and trust that must bear us into heaven. It means that there
is an affectionateness in God that looks to what we are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
rather than what we do, and more readily speaks to us of
communion than of obedience. True, this is but another
way of saying what our religion elsewhere more ethically
expresses, that God requires our perfect service, and yet has
forgiveness for what is imperfect. But this statement, though
it means also that heaven is open to the pure, intent, and
single heart, touches a spring less deep and strong. It
divides the integral and living fact, even in regard to God,
by describing it as a demand of the whole, and then a subtraction
of a part; and so exhibiting it rather as a dissolution
of justice, than as truth and wholeness of love. And the
Pauline doctrine appeals with far more immediate power to
human consciousness, especially to that third of mankind
whom a fervid enthusiastic mind renders little accessible to
the cold solemnities of duty. And, finally, if we are insensible
to the grandeur of St. Paul's teaching as to the universality
of the Gospel, it is not more because it is entangled
with the question of Jew and Gentile, than because the sentiment
has become the common atmosphere of Christendom,
and we feel not its freshness, because it blows not on us as a
breeze, but <i>only</i> as our breath of life. Let Mr. Jowett remove
from us the spell of our indifference.</p>

<p>"Let us turn aside for a moment to consider how great this
thought was in that age and country; a thought which the
wisest of men had never before uttered, which even at the
present hour we imperfectly realize, which is still leavening
the world, and shall do so until the whole is leavened, and
the differences of races, of nations, of castes, of religions, of
languages, are fully done away. Nothing could seem a less
natural or obvious lesson in the then state of the world;
nothing could be more at variance with experience, or more
difficult to carry out into practice. Even to us it is hard to
imagine that the islander of the South Seas, the pariah of
India, the African in his worst estate, is equally with ourselves
God's creature. But in the age of St. Paul, how great
must have been the difficulty of conceiving barbarian and
Scythian, bond and free,&mdash;all colors, forms, races, and languages,&mdash;alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
and equal in the presence of God who made
them! The origin of the human race was veiled in a deeper
mystery to the ancient world, and the lines which separated
mankind were harder and stronger; yet the 'love of
Christ constraining' bound together in its cords those most
separated by time or distance; those who were the types of
the most extreme differences of which the human race is
capable.</p>

<p>"The thought of this brotherhood of all mankind, the
great family on earth, not only implies that all men have certain
rights and claims at our hands; it is also a thought of
peace and comfort. First, it leads us to rest in God, not as
selecting us because he had a favor unto us, but as infinitely
just to all mankind. To think of ourselves, or our Church,
or our age, as the particular exceptions of his mercy, is not a
thought of comfort, but of perplexity. Secondly, it links our
fortunes with those of men in general, and gives us the same
support in reference to our eternal destiny, that we receive
from each other in a narrow sphere in the concerns of daily
life. Thirdly, it relieves us from all anxiety about the condition
of other men, of friends departed, of those ignorant of
the Gospel, of those of a different form of faith from our own,
knowing that God, who has thus far lifted up the veil, 'will
justify the circumcision through faith, and the uncircumcision
by faith'; the Jew who fulfils the law, and the Gentile who
does by nature the things contained in the law."&mdash;Vol. II. p.
126.</p>

<p>What the doctrine of universality in the Divine government
was to that age,&mdash;as new and transporting,&mdash;is in our
own "the clear perception of the moral nature of God, and of
his infinite truth and justice." This is one of the many deep
sayings, sad and wise, quietly dropped by our author in a series
of disquisitions, that show, among other things, how well
he understands its scope. Everywhere his care is to disengage
Christianity from the theological conceptions fastened on it by
a coarser age; and, having restored the purity of its moral
vision, to enlarge its horizon to the whole extent of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
knowledge and experience. Penetrating beneath the figures
natural to St. Paul, the very changes of which show them
to <i>be</i> figures, he finds that nothing can be more abhorrent
from the Apostle's thought than the doctrine of "satisfaction,"
which is hunted down, in every form, with exhaustive and indignant
logic; that even the analogy of sacrifice "rather
shows us what the death of Christ was not, than what it
was"; and that to draw us into union with Christ, to fix
our eye on his pure self-renunciation as "the greatest moral
act ever done in this world," to keep us in a mood that harmonizes
our trust in God with our distrust of ourselves, and
to suggest more than it can explain of hope and peace to a
reconciled world, are the real functions, as of his death, so of
all the stages of his existence. This pure type of faith emerges,
we venture to affirm, without straining the rights of the
interpreter. The rest and freedom it gives to the mind is
singularly evident in the fine essay on Natural Religion.
The author sets forth from the Christian centre, and, consciously
marking where he passes the boundary of the apostolic
view, surveys and brings to its religious place the whole outlying
realm of nature, history, and life, that was unknown to
Scripture, but is fact to us. The great Gentile religions, now
discriminated and interpreted, and ascertained to follow certain
laws of development; the breadth in philosophies, purer
and brighter as history passed on; the Natural Religion,
which is the counterpart of these in Christian times, and holds
its place by the side of revelation; and the ordinary state of
character in morally good but unspiritual persons, (state of
"nature" rather than of "grace,")&mdash;are reviewed and estimated
with a breadth of observation and a delicacy of reflection
singularly impressive. Indeed, the literature of religious
philosophy affords few nobler productions than this essay.
With how true a hand and bright a touch is the following picture
drawn! We will but hang it up in our reader's imagination,
and leave him to commune with it alone.</p>

<p>"It is impossible not to observe that innumerable persons,&mdash;may
we not say the majority of mankind?&mdash;who have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
belief in God and immortality, have nevertheless hardly any
consciousness of the peculiar doctrines of the Gospel. They
seem to live aloof from them in the routine of business or of
pleasure, 'the common life of all men,' not without a sense of
right, and a rule of truth and honesty, yet insensible to what
our Saviour meant by taking up the cross and following him,
or what St. Paul meant by 'being one with Christ.' They
die without any great fear or lively hope; to the last more
interested about the least concerns of this world than about the
greatest of another. They have never in their whole lives
experienced the love of God, or the sense of sin, or the need
of forgiveness. Often they are remarkable for the purity of
their morals; many of them have strong and disinterested
attachments, and quick human sympathies; sometimes a stoical
feeling of uprightness, or a peculiar sensitiveness to dishonor.
It would be a mistake to say they are without religion.
They join in its public acts; they are offended at profaneness
or impiety; they are thankful for the blessings of
life, and do not rebel against its misfortunes. Such men meet
us at every turn. They are those whom we know and associate
with; honest in their dealings, respectable in their lives,
decent in their conversation. The Scripture speaks to us of
two classes, represented by the Church and the world, the
wheat and the tares, the sheep and the goats, the friends and
enemies of God. We cannot say in which of the two divisions
we should find a place for them.</p>

<p>"The picture is a true one, and, if we change the light by
which we look at it, may be a resemblance of ourselves no less
than of other men. Others will include most of us in the
same circle in which we are including them. What shall we
say to such a state, common as it is to both us and them?
The fact that we are considering is not the evil of the world,
but the neutrality of the world, the indifference of the world,
the inertness of the world. There are multitudes of men and
women everywhere who have no peculiarly Christian feelings,
to whom, except for the indirect influence of Christian institutions,
the fact that Christ died on the cross for their sins has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
made no difference; and who have, nevertheless, the common
sense of truth and right almost equally with true Christians.
You cannot say of them, 'There is none that doeth good; no,
not one.' The other tone of St. Paul is more suitable:
'When the Gentiles that know not the law do by nature the
things contained in the law, these not knowing the law are a
law unto themselves.' So of what we commonly term the
world, as opposed to those who make a profession of Christianity,
we must not shrink from saying, 'When men of the
world do by nature whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report,
these, not being conscious of the grace of God, do by nature
what can only be done by his grace.' Why should we make
them out worse than they are? We must cease to speak evil
of them ere they will judge fairly of the characters of religious
men. That, with so little recognition of His personal relation
to them, God has not cast them off, is a ground of hope
rather than of fear,&mdash;of thankfulness, not of regret."&mdash;Vol.
II. p. 416.</p>

<h2><a name="SIN_WHAT_IT_IS_WHAT_IT_IS_NOT" id="SIN_WHAT_IT_IS_WHAT_IT_IS_NOT">SIN: WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT IS NOT.</a></h2>

<blockquote class="hangind"><p>"Now the end of the commandment is Charity, out of a pure heart, and of
a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."&mdash;1 Timothy i. 5.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Apostle gives us here a very simple formula of
Christian perfection. He was not fond of long lists of the
virtues, such as the moral philosophers draw up; and though
he does sometimes pass through a series, it is with a peculiar
result. Look at any book upon human ethics, and you are
astonished at the number of qualities that go to make up a
good man: the ramifications of duty seem never to terminate:
you scarcely know how a soul like ours can hold so much:
the further the author proceeds in his enumeration, the less
does he seem able to stop,&mdash;his divisions breaking into subdivisions,
and the subdivisions opening new varieties,&mdash;till
life appears to pulverize itself under his definitions, and become
an infinite complexity of moral detail. St. Paul's enumerations,
on the contrary, instead of running down into
multitude, run up into unity; each term is apt to be larger
than its predecessor; he seems impatient of scattering his
exhortations, as if each had a business of its own, and rather
forces them as he proceeds into denser compression, till he
flings out some term of power that holds them all. The
graces with him do not present themselves apart, like garden
plants that may be tended and watered one by one; but all
on the same organism, as the leaves and the blossoms of a
single shrub. He felt that in reality the virtues do not add
themselves up and subscribe to the final result of a holy soul:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
but the one simple soul lives itself out into the direction of
all the virtues; and there is a certain mood, a temper, a
climate of the soul, which grows everything beautiful at once,
and without which, while one adornment is elaborately nursed,
the rest will be apt to droop and die. This blessed and productive
mood, felt to be <i>one thing</i>, ought to have <i>one name</i>:
and the Apostle calls it <i>Charity</i> or <i>Love</i>; and presents it
sometimes as the greatest of graces, sometimes as the unity
of them all.</p>

<p>But this simple grace is to have a <i>triple source</i>. In the
midst of the garden of the Lord the Apostle plants but a solitary
tree of life,&mdash;his divine and fruitful Charity. Only it
must be nursed by the threefold root, of which should any
part be wanting, the beauty of the form and the healing of
the leaves will soon be gone. "Charity out of a pure heart,&mdash;and
a good conscience,&mdash;and faith unfeigned." The
Heart, the Conscience, the Faith, must all be right; and it is
no Pauline Charity that is not sustained by concurrence of
them all. And, observe <i>the order</i>. In the centre, striking
its fibres deepest down into the substance of our world, is the
<i>Conscience</i>, the <i>Moral</i> element of life; and on either side,
held to their due balance by its intermediate power, we find
the <i>Heart</i>,&mdash;the fresh <i>human affections</i>,&mdash;and the Faith,&mdash;the
<i>heavenly trust and aspirations</i>,&mdash;of our nature. Tenderness
and pity on the one hand, devotion and hope on the
other, are to hold on to the sense of duty in the midst; and
there only will a noble and majestic Love arise, casting no
baneful shade upon the earth, and in its branches giving no
shelter but to birds that sing the songs of heaven. A charity,
therefore, that flows <i>only</i> from the genial heart, that looks
with kindly complacency on all things and persons, and with
a sort of animal sympathy licks every sore of humanity that
lies at its gate;&mdash;this is not the "end of the commandment";&mdash;for
it has in it no moral, no religious element: it condemns
nothing; it worships nothing: its eye neither flashes in rebuke,
nor lifts itself in prayer: it is sensitive to suffering, not
to sin: and, if it can but wipe out pain, will do it even upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
guilty terms, and charm away a God-sent remorse as freely
as it would an anguish of the innocent. And, on the other
hand, a charity that flows only from the sincerity of faith,
and limits itself to the fellowship of belief; that feels perhaps
<i>for</i> many, but only <i>with</i> a few; whose warmest sympathies
are little else than a partnership of antipathies; that transfers
to the infinite God the narrowness of its own consecrated
circle, reduces the universe to a temple of orthodoxy, and
turns the Heaven of Immortals into the May-meeting of a
sect;&mdash;this also misses "the end of the commandment": for
it abuses the true power of religion over life, and flings in the
branch of faith only to embitter, instead of sweeten, the waters
of natural affection; it blinds and bewilders the moral discernment,
overlooks undeniable nobleness, and glorifies not a
little meanness; and, applying its perverted admiration to the
past as well as the present, crowds the statue-gallery of history
with ill-favored and questionable saints, whose features
have so grown to the mould and pressure of a creed, that
they look like casts of an abstract theology, more than emblems
of a living humanity. Take away the wisdom of Conscience;
and Charity, surrendered to mere affection, will fail
to see sin where <i>it is</i>; or, constricted by Faith, will suppose
it where <i>it is not</i>. Both errors will shape themselves into
deliberate doctrines, deviating on either side from the simple
creed of our moral nature and of Christ. Let us look for a
few moments at the central truth on this matter; and then
glance from it at the lateral heresies.</p>

<p>The central truth may be described under the phrase, <i>The
Personal nature of sin</i>. In affirming this, I mean both that
<i>each man is a person, and not a thing</i>; and that <i>his sin is his
own, and not another's</i>. If there is anything within the compass
of heaven and earth which we can be said to know from
ourselves, and to have no need that another should tell us, it
is the nature of sin. There is no arrogance,&mdash;there is only
sorrowful confession,&mdash;in protesting that <i>this</i> is a matter on
which we cannot be mistaken. It is the nearest of all things
to us; the shadow that follows us where we go, and stays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
with us when we sit; the clinging presence that penetrates
the very folds of our nature, and is known only from within,
where its fibres strike and draw their nutriment. No external
observer, though he have the divination of a prophet or the
glance of an archangel, can add one iota to our insight into
this sad fact, unless by sharpening our sensibility to feel and
interpret it better for ourselves; or by any testimony, any
miracle, take one line away of the handwriting of God that
burns and flashes on the inner walls of the soul. Here at
least our apprehensions are first-hand; and to trust them, to
cast out as Satan what tampers with them or contradicts them,
is not scepticism, but faith,&mdash;not infidelity, but faithfulness
to the ever-living Word of God. What the finger of Heaven
has written, neither the tapestries of ancient theology nor the
varnish of the newest philosophy can permanently hide; the
light is alive, and will eat through, clearing its everlasting
warning and consuming our perishable work.</p>

<p>What then does this first and last revelation declare human
sin to be? In the moments when we know it best,&mdash;when we
cover our face because we can hide our transgression no more,&mdash;when
we cannot bear the placid silence of things, and cry in
our agony, "Smite us, O Lord, but tell us what we have done,"&mdash;does
He not answer us, "You have abused your trust;
I showed you a better, and you have taken the worse; I drew
you by a secret reverence to the nobler, and you have sunk
by inclination to the baser; I gave you a will in the image
of my own, free to realize the good, and you have yielded
yourself captive to the evil; therefore have you a burden
now to bear, that none can lift off,&mdash;a burden which you
will feel it more faithful and wholesome to carry than to lose."
This is surely the tone in which the voice of God's Holy Spirit
speaks to us when we have grieved it: and if we believe it
not, I know not whither we should go; it is the highest
oracle of truth below the skies, having authority more positive
even than the eye that assures us of the sun above us,
and the feet that tell us of the earth beneath.</p>

<p>According to this oracle, then, the essence of the sin lies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
the <i>conscious free choice of the worse in presence of a better no
less possible</i>. And to make us guilty in its commission three conditions
are required;&mdash;(1.) Our mind must be solicited by at
least two competing propensities; (2.) We must be aware that
of these one is worthy and has a claim upon us, and the other
not; (3.) It must be left to us to determine ourselves to either
of these, and we must not be delivered over by foreign causes
to the one or to the other. Take away any of these conditions,
and guilt becomes impossible. If the mind has <i>not</i> the
option of two propensities, but is possessed of only one, that
single impulse, being its entire stock and constituting its only
possibility, affords no scope for good or ill, and leaves the
being a mere creature of instinct. Or if, while rival passions
struggle at his heart, he knows no difference among them, or
only this, that some are <i>pleasanter</i> than others, then also he
is blameless, though he takes only what he likes. If, finally,
while he is drawn by conflicting tendencies and taught to
regard <i>some</i> as his temptations, and solemnly set in the midst
to choose, the whole appearance of option turns out a semblance
and a pretence, and the matter is long ago determined
outside of him and now only performs the ceremony of <i>passing
through</i> him,&mdash;then, as before, he is irreproachable: the
strife within him is the illusion of mimic passions wrestling
for a dreamer's soul; and while the tragic agony goes on
within,&mdash;a dance of fiends, a rescue of angels,&mdash;he is
stretched all the while sleeping on the bed of nature, and
cannot wake but to find remorse and responsibility a dream.</p>

<p>Accordingly, whenever we want to make excuse for our
wrong-doing, the false plea takes the form of a denial of one
of these conditions. "Blame me not," we say, "for <i>I knew of
no other</i> course"; or, "I did not <i>think it signified</i> which I
did"; or, "I saw it all, but <i>I could not help it</i>." Often the
gnawings of self-reproach are felt upon the heart at the very
instant that these excuses escape the lips. But sometimes
they are the suggestions of <i>sincere</i> self-deception, and proceed
from men who are their own dupes; and whenever this is the
case, the sense of responsibility is entirely dissipated; remorse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
is extinguished; the confession of guilt is turned into complaint
of a misfortune; and the offender considers himself
rather as the injured of nature than the insurgent against
God. These excuses then must be wholly excluded, if the
sanctity of the moral life is to be preserved. They are the
various forms under which the personal nature of sin may be
denied. They all assert that the <i>person</i> either did not contain
within him the requisite conditions, or was hemmed in
by natural preventives, of true obligation. Whoever offers
us such pleas is justly regarded as self-condemned, and indeed
as presenting a sadder spectacle in his defence than in
his transgression. Nor are they improved in their character
when they are expanded from excuses of individuals into
doctrines of churches; for they explain away the essence of
sin, and leave us without intelligible faith in anything holy
in heaven or on earth. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whoever maintains that the human heart is invariably
wicked, and can think no thought and prompt no act, except
such as are odious to God, mistakes the whole nature of
moral obligation, and virtually excludes it from the entire
system of things. Confront this assertion with the facts of
life, and ask what it really means. Do you mean, I would
say to its defender, that, whenever two principles contend for
the mastery in a man's mind, he always abandons himself
to the lower?&mdash;that no one, in short, was ever known to resist
a temptation? Such a position is surely too bold for the paradox
of cynicism itself, in a world where there are many in
want that do not steal, and in suffering that do not complain;
where a Pericles could administer the revenues of a state,
yet die without having added to his little patrimony; and a
Socrates could live pure amid corruption, and truthful amid
lies, and die the martyr of injustice rather than offend his
reverence for law; where not a school nor a family can be
found that has not its annals and anecdotes of conscience.
You allow, therefore, that victors there have been in many a
temptation. Did it make then no difference to the sentiments
of God respecting them whether they were victors or vanquished?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
Was it neutral to him whether they nobly held
their post, or basely betrayed it? Then you simply deny the
holiness of God; for you allow the greatest contrasts of character
on earth, with no responsive feeling, no variety of estimate,
in heaven; and make our human discernment, our
natural admirations, more susceptible as moral barometers
than the Omniscient Perception. Or will you say that, although
men differ in moral effort, and withstand temptation
in various degrees, and the Infinite Eye sees through the
whole history with unerring exactitude, yet the entire scale of
human character lies below the point of Divine acceptableness,
and in the view of perfect purity is equivalent to mere
variety of guilt? Then do you deny again, only with a
change of form, the personal nature of sin; for you try the
soul by the law of <i>another</i> nature, and not her own,&mdash;by a
law beyond her ken or beyond her power; and while she is
striving to be faithful to her best thought against the seductions
of the worse,&mdash;in which alone the essence of all goodness
dwells,&mdash;you tell her that her God despises a conflict so far
down, and that "this people that knoweth not his law," however
true to their own, "is cursed." What is this but to
make Moral Excellence something quite different in heaven
and on earth?&mdash;not veracity, not justice, not purity of thought,
not self-sacrificing love; nothing that here makes our hearts
burn within us as we look at the dear face of long-tried
friends or saintly strangers, or leaving the Jerusalem of the
noisy present pace the quiet road of history, talking by the
way with the saviours of nations and the prophets of a
world;&mdash;not this, but some hidden charm that finds neither
place nor answer in our souls; so that the God who loves it
leaves us herein without a point of sympathy with him, or a
possibility of approach. In that case, he is a Being without
moral perfection; for, however you may apply to him a circle
of holy <i>names</i>, the things you denote by them are a set
of unknown quantities bearing no relation to our types of
thought. Or, finally, do you allege that the distinctions of
character are not entirely different in heaven and on earth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
only that through all their varieties in the natural man there
is interfused a certain invariable taint, an irremovable tinge
of guilt,&mdash;a stain of <i>self</i>, a thought of <i>pride</i>, a want of <i>faith</i>?
Even were it so, still, if this be the constant coloring of the
soul, pervading it by nature and not personally incurred, it is
but a sad condition under which it is given us to work out
our problem, and not any unfaithfulness in dealing with it as
it comes: it is an inherent incapacity, which, however unlike
the beauty of God's holiness, he can no more regard with
penal disapproval, than he can hate the deformed or persecute
the blind.</p>

<p>Again, whoever teaches that men are, through and through,
the creatures of circumstance, with no more voice as to their
character than as to their birth, but are the predestined products
of nature, working partly within them and partly without,&mdash;no
less surely insults all moral convictions, and denies
the reality of duty. For he abolishes entirely the distinction
between a person and a thing; and conceives of every man
as a mere <i>growth</i> or <i>development</i> from the physiology of the
universe, no more responsible for his place in the scale of
excellence, than the plant which, according to its seed and
soil, becomes the hyssop of the wall, the lily of the field, or
the stately cedar of Lebanon. All moral ideas vanish instantly
at the touch of this doctrine; and the solemn language
on which Law and Conscience have stamped their venerable
impress, and ruled among the nations "by the grace of God,"
is defaced in the revolutionary mint of fatalism, and made
current with the superscription of a pretended equality where
all are low, and liberty where none is free. It is quite clear,
that, if the soul has no originating causality, but in every step
she takes is simply <i>disposed of</i> and bespoken by agencies
provided and set in train, without any question asked of her,
she can have no <i>duties</i>, she can win no <i>deserts</i>; she can
incur no <i>guilt</i>, merit no <i>punishment</i>; she is deluded in her
<i>remorse</i>, and suffers a vain torture in esteeming herself an
<i>alien from God</i>. All that remains is this: that by natural
laws there may be pain consequent, and known to be consequent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
on some of the directions which we may take; and it
is at our peril that we enter on these paths. But so is it at
our peril if we go up in a balloon, or put to sea in a small
boat to save a drowning crew. You can get nothing out of this
consideration but more or less of <i>Prudence</i>; hope of happiness,
fear of suffering, can consecrate nothing as a <i>Duty</i>, but
only present it as <i>interest</i>; and if a man chooses to disregard
his interest and risk the result, I know not who, in heaven
or earth, can tell him with authority that he has no right to
do it, or can say more to him than that he is a fool in his
folly. Who on these terms could cast himself, in tears of
penitence, upon the bosom of Infinite Mercy, and sob out his
prayer that he might be reconciled to God? Who would
ever tremble beneath the lash of a fiery reproach, and own,
as it quivered over him, that there was justice in the terror
of its look? Rather must the sinner feel himself the victim
of a cruel doom; whom it is as little suitable to punish, as to
chastise the patient in fever, or torture the cripple in the
street. A doctrine which reduces duty to interest, retribution
to discipline, guilt to disease, holiness to symmetry and
good health, and God to the neutral source of all things good
and ill;&mdash;which frightens us with fears we may defy, but
awes us with no authority we can revere; which pities iniquity
and smiles on goodness, but only in order to patronize enjoyment;&mdash;whose
faith in human nature is a reliance on the
ultimate docility of the wild animal man; and whose worship
of God is taken, like a morning walk, for the sake of exercise;&mdash;is
so alien from the whole spirit of religion, and such an
affront to the first instincts of conscience, that it can only escape
indignant condemnation by withdrawing altogether into
the sphere of natural history, and quitting as a foreign province
the domain&mdash;whose language it corrupts&mdash;of Morals
and of Faith.</p>

<p>Finally, those who teach that guilt and merit, with their
penalties and rewards, can be transferred, deny in the directest
way the personal nature of Sin. That men should find a
foreign <i>remedy</i> for their perpetrated wickedness, is not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
shocking than that they should trace it to a foreign <i>source</i>. If
they know what it is at all, they feel it to be inalienably their
own; which none could give them and which none can take
away. And nothing is more amazing than that good Christians,
who seem truly cast down in humiliation, oppressed with
the sense of their short-comings, penetrated with the sadness
of baffled aspiration,&mdash;and who therefore, one would think,
must really have a consciousness of the personality of sin,
and know how it is chargeable only on their individual will,&mdash;can
yet obtain relief by flying, as it is said, to the cross, and
persuading themselves that the evil has been stayed and cured
by transactions wholly outside themselves, and belonging to
the history of another being. What can possibly be meant
by the statement that Christ has borne the punishment, some
eighteen hundred years ago, of your sins and mine,&mdash;of people
non-existent then, and therefore non-sinful? Can the punishment
precede the sin? Can it be inflicted and gone through
before it is even determined whether the sin will be perpetrated
at all? Or can merely <i>potential</i> sin, which may never become
actual, be dealt with at ages distant, and its accounts be
settled ere it arise? If so, what is the death of Christ but the
provisory accumulation of a fund beforehand, ready to be
drawn upon as the everlasting "treasure of the Church," for
the free discharge of guilty debts and the release of divine
obligations? And in what respect does this differ from the
Roman Catholic doctrine,&mdash;except that the treasure is at the
discretion of no chartered sacerdotal company, but is open on
more popular and looser terms?</p>

<p>Moral relations, by their very nature, exclude all vicarious
agency; you cannot fall, you cannot recover, by deputy:
the ill that haunts you is the insult you have put on the divine
spirit in your heart, and it is as if you were alone with God.
An interposing medium can as little divert the retribution, as
it can intercept the complacency of the Infinite and Holy
Mind. What more fearful charge could you bring against
any government, than to say that its penalties may be bought
off? A judge who accepts the voluntary sufferings of innocence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
in acquittance of the liabilities of guilt, shocks every
sentiment of justice, and does that which the worst judicial
caprice would never dare to imitate. A law that does not
care whether the right persons feel its retribution, provided it
gets an equivalent suffering elsewhere, is an affront to the
most elementary notions of right. And an offender who can
welcome his escape by such device, permits his moral perceptions
to be blinded by personal gratitude, and is content to
profit by a transaction which it would fill him with remorse
to repeat upon his own children.</p>

<p>A Mediator may do much indeed to reconcile my alienated
mind to God. He may personally rise before me with a purity
and greatness so unique as to give me faith in diviner
things than I had known before, and by his higher image turn
my eye towards the Highest of all. He may show me how,
in the sublimest natures, sanctity and tenderness ever blend,
and so touch the springs of inward reverence that, in my returning
sympathy with goodness, all abject and deterring fears
are swept away. He may direct upon me, from the hall of
trial or the cross of self-sacrifice, the loving look that prostrates
the impulses of passion and the power of self, and awakens
the repentant enthusiasm of nobler affections. He may
renew my future; but he cannot change my past. He may
sprinkle my immediate soul with the wave of regeneration;
but he cannot drown the deeds that are gone. From <i>present
sinfulness</i> he may recover me; but the <i>perpetrated sins</i>&mdash;though
he be God himself in power, unless he be other than
God in holiness&mdash;he cannot redeem. These have become
realized facts; and none can cut off the entail of their consequences:
whatever the Divine Law has avowedly annexed to
them will develop itself from them with infallible certainty.
The outward sufferings by which God has stamped into the
nature of things his disapprobation of sin, and made it grievous
here and hereafter, stand irrevocably fast, clinging to
guilt as shadow to body, as effect to cause. This debt of natural
penalty is one which must be paid to the utmost farthing;
by penitent and impenitent, by the reconciled and the unreconciled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
alike: miracle cannot cancel, nor mediator discharge
it. In this sense,&mdash;of rescue from the penal laws of God,&mdash;I
know of no remission of sins; nor would Christians have
retained so heathenish a notion, had they not frightfully exaggerated,
in the first instance, the retributions of God by
making them an <i>eternal vengeance</i>; and so created a necessity
for again rescinding the fierce enactments of their fancy,
that hope and return might not be quite shut out. It is only
in man, however, and not in God, thus to do and undo. His
word, whether of warning or of promise, is Yea and Amen;
and his great realities will march serenely on, and, heedless of
our passionate deprecations and fictitious triumphs, rebuke
our unbelief of their veracity.</p>

<p>But while the past can never be as though it were not, the
present may lie in the shelter of reconciliation, and the future
in the light of boundless hope. The outer burden we have
incurred we may still have to bear; but once brought by
Divine conversion to an inner sympathy with God, and seeing
by his light rather than our own, we can suffer our
wounds with a patient shame, and scarcely feel their anguish
more. The averted face of the Infinite has turned round upon
us again; and the pure eyes look into us with a mild and
loving gaze, which we can meet with answering glance, and
feel that we are at one with the universe and reconciled with
God.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

two passages is so obviously merely of a verbal nature, that
it can perplex only the blind interpreter who penetrates no
further than the letter of the sacred volume. I should only
be giving utterance to your own spontaneous reflections, my
friends, were I to tell you that my text speaks, not of the design,
but of the consequence, of the dissemination of the Gospel;
and that it indicates no more than a prophetic knowledge
on the part of Christ of the diversities of sentiment and feeling
which would spring from the diffusion of his religion.
This prophetic knowledge, however, it does clearly indicate;
and this is a fact of no mean importance. The unbeliever
objects to Christianity, and the Roman Catholic to Protestantism,
the endless catalogue of discordant opinions which have
resulted from their prevalence; and to both we are furnished
with one reply. This infinite diversity indicates no failure in
our system; it is not an unexpected effect which startles and
alarms us; it was foreseen by the Author of our religion, and
announced by him as the necessary consequence of the genuine
preaching of his Apostles. And though he had this evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
(if such it be) full in view, he did not retreat from the office
he had assumed, nor feel it at variance with his deep and tender
philanthropy, to implant among mankind a faith that
should break up their united mass into a thousand repulsive
groups.</p>

<p>He must then have known that his Gospel would carry
with it blessings which this seeming disadvantage would not
cancel,&mdash;blessings far surpassing the evils of division,&mdash;a
peace which no jarrings of controversy could disturb,&mdash;a good-will
that could triumph over the alienations of party. Were
it my object, it would be easy to show that the distribution of
the Christian world into sects has achieved incalculably more
good than it has inflicted injury; that the rudest conflicts of
a militant theology are preferable to the hollow peace of universal
thraldom; that the fluctuating surface of human opinion,
with all its restless lights, is a fairer object than its dark
and leaden stagnation; that discussion multiplies the chances
of truth, diffuses the thirst for knowledge, leads forth reason
from the mist, converts prejudice into conviction, and gives to
a dead faith a moral and operative power. It would be easy
to show that our religion, especially since it has issued from the
cloister into the light of day, has accomplished a vast amount
of good, with which no controversy has been able to interfere;
that it has imparted nobler sentiments of duty, given to conscience
a more majestic voice, raised the depressed portions of
society; that it has enabled moral refinement to keep pace
with the intellectual advancement of mankind; that it has
given modesty to the sublimest exercise of reason, by erecting
towering and eternal truths beyond whose shadow reason cannot
fly. It would be easy to anticipate the time when the benign
principles of Christianity shall mellow down the ruggedness
of party feeling, and extract the lingering selfishness that
poisons discussion with its bitterness; when the unrestricted
and disinterested love of truth shall no longer be an empty
fiction; when the differences between mind and mind will be
but so many converging paths by which mankind, with one
heart and one speed, hasten to the same goal of certainty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
But it is not my object to insist on the advantages of controversy,
or to predict its future triumphs; but rather to warn
against some of its dangers, and to suggest a few thoughts
which may throw light on the duties of Christians in an age
so controversial as ours. To me, reflecting on the principles
of the Association at whose anniversary I speak, no topic
seems more appropriate. Our grand uniting principle is, the
rejection of all creeds and human formularies of faith, and a
simple adherence to the sacred volume, as being "able," without
comment or interpretation, "to make wise unto salvation."
We think confessions enough have been tried, and been found
wanting; that every such attempt to produce uniformity is utterly
chimerical, and an impotent rebellion against the laws of
the human mind. Believing then that unanimity is one of the
weakest dreams of the visionary and the fanatic, we expect to
see diversity of sentiment among Christians; we cannot be
surprised, and ought not to be displeased, to see the religious
world full of the activity of discussion. But since we agree
to abandon mankind to their divergencies of opinion, it is peculiarly
incumbent on us to consider what new moral aspect
society assumes, when distributed into differing denominations,
and what new duties arise in an age of doctrinal debate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I. It is the duty of Christians to remember how many are
their points of union.</p>

<p>Is our religion, my friends, a matter of the intellect only,&mdash;a
mere mine of inexhaustible speculation? I grant that it is
in perfect unison with the dictates of enlightened reason, and
that it administers the noblest stimulus and worthiest employment
to the faculties of the mind. But are not its ultimate
dealings with the affections? Does it not present to us new
objects of love, new scenes of hope, a new system of desires?
Does it not unlock the springs of human feeling, and pour the
full tide of emotion upon the soul? What else can so melt in
penitence, so solemnize with awe, so prostrate in fear, so enkindle
with joy? What else can impart such majestic power
to human will to trample in the dust peril and anguish and
temptation, to conquer the solicitations of self-love, and pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
with meek inflexibility deserted and solitary ways of duty?
For the greatest triumphs of our faith we must go where it
is matched with the passions of the heart, the impulses of unregulated
nature, and see how it prunes their exuberance,
enriches their sterility, purifies their pollutions, expands their
littleness, refines their ruggedness. Now these influences are
common to every form of Christianity; its appeals to the affections
are not uttered in the vocabulary of sectarianism, but
in the universal language of the human heart. Some may
prefer to deck the form of our religion in the gorgeous colors
of an imposing ritual; some may throw round it the ample
folds of mystery; others may love rather the grace of its primitive
simplicity; but beneath all these varieties the same living
figure breathes, the same radiant features smile. Where is the
system of Christianity that does not present to our affections
an Infinite Being, who has shadowed forth his invisible glories
in the splendors of the universe, who rolls the silent wheels of
time, whose presence, felt in other worlds, is secretly shed
around each human home, who traces the tear of grief and
lights up the smile of peace, who has an eye on every heart,
and carries on his parental discipline in scenes beyond our vision
and without an end? Where is the system of Christianity
which does not lead us to the Saviour as the image of the
invisible God, as the bright reflection of his character, and the
noblest assurance of his love,&mdash;which does not trace to Jesus
innumerable moral blessings, and call us to reverence him for
guidance amid the intricacies of duty, for light in the chamber
of grief, for power of endurance amid the struggles of suffering
nature, and prospects of attractive grandeur beyond the
grave? Where is the system of Christianity which does not
cast upon this state the shadow of an eternal tribunal,&mdash;which
does not associate with sin the horrors of the outer darkness,
and impart an infinite value to every pure tendency of the
soul, by inviting virtue to a never-ending progression replete
with ineffable joy? What Christian has not enshrined in his
memory and his admiration the most beautiful and touching
portions of the volume of our faith? Is there a Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
parent that can read the invitation of the benevolent Jesus,
"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,"
without a heart of love to the Heavenly Teacher, without a purified
conception of that kingdom which infantine docility alone
can enter, without an uplifting of prayer that no rude world
may ever brush from the mind of his child the morning dews
of his innocence? Is there a Christian sister that has not
blessed the Divine Teacher, who, himself touched by the sorrows
that he quelled, restored the lost Lazarus to his weeping
and defenceless home? Is there a Christian mother who has
not lingered with the bereaved Mary around the cross, wondered
at her awful sorrows, and thought how in the watches
of the night memory would bring back upon her ear that last
appeal, "Woman, behold thy son"? The tears which flow at
passages like these, the admiration with which they burden the
heart, the images of moral loveliness with which they fill the
imagination, are not the exclusive possession of any sect; they
are the unrestricted boon of God to the human soul. In private,
then, we all ponder the same book, gather from it the
same refreshing influence, the same impressions of duty, the
same impulses to prayer. And on our Christian Sabbath,
while we tread the threshold of differing temples, are they not
all dedicated to Him "who dwelleth not in temples made with
hands," and regardeth not their trivial distinctions? While
the worshipping multitudes utter a various language and ill-harmonizing
thoughts, are they not addressing a Being to
whom language is but a breath, and human thought but like
an infant's dream, and who looks only to that heart of love
that animates them both? It is an exhilarating thought, that
though on that sacred day Christians may be separated by
land and seas, gathered around myriads of sanctuaries, and
speaking in a thousand tongues, their praises blend like kindred
fires as they rise, and burst into the courts of God, one
brilliant flame of incense from the universal shrine of the human
heart.</p>

<p>These, my fellow-Christians, are thoughts which we should
cherish, to convince us how much, amid all our diversities, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
have in common; to show us that the best, the living portion
of our faith, is others' as well as our own; and to soften those
strange animosities that embitter our weak tempers, and enfeeble
the heavenly ties that encircle the whole family of God.
If there be any truth in the remark of a philosopher, that the
essence of friendship is to have the same desires and aversions,
how much ground have all Christians for mutual love! Widely
as their speculations may diverge, the great concern of all
is with God, the Infinite Father; with Christ, the commissioned
prophet, the merciful redeemer, the inspired teacher,
the perfect model, the heavenly guide; with eternity, the seat
of our deepest and most permanent interests, the receptacle of
our lost friends, the grave of virtuous sorrow, the home of the
tossed and faithful spirit. No one can live habitually under
the influence of these grand and affecting objects, and turn
from them to condescend to the littleness of a polemical temper.
They will impart their own greatness to his soul, and
give him that best of powers,&mdash;the power over himself. Such
a one may use the pen of controversy without fear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. But I confess that the contemplation of these points of
union would impart little peace to our minds, or serenity to
our tempers, if at the same time we believed that the differences
of our faith would follow us into the eternal future, and
determine our condition there. I therefore observe, in the
second place, that, amid all our controversies, it is of moment
that we should remember the moral innocence of mental error.
This principle, my friends, seems to me to be intimately connected
with our right of private judgment. We might claim
for men the privilege of free investigation, and affix no temporal
rewards or punishments to any system; yet this would
be but a worthless boon, if we upheld over any creed the penal
menace of eternity. We should thus only transfer the
bribe from men's interests to their fears; we should push our
exclusion from earth, only to give it a vaster theatre in heaven.
As many Christians, not otherwise disposed to be narrow
in their spirit, have some lingering doubts respecting this primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
principle of Christian charity, suffer me to say a few
words with a view to establish the perfect innocence of mental
error. The exclusionist rests the burden of his argument
on one text, which, unhappily for Christian love, has been left
somewhat elliptical in its expression. "He that believeth and
is baptized, shall be saved; he that believeth not, shall be
damned." Believeth what? Transubstantiation, says the
Catholic; miraculous conversion, says the Wesleyan; the
vicarious atonement, replies the Calvinist; the Trinity, says
the Athanasian Creed. Every one has an anathema for the
opponent of his favorite tenet; and the still, small voice of
charity is swept away by the conflicting winds of controversy,
and dies unheard. Let us see whether our Heavenly Father
will not permit us to open those gates of mercy which others
have so sternly closed.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for our present purpose to inquire what
are the salvation and condemnation of which the passage in
question speaks. It may be conceded without injury to our
argument, that they have reference to the destinies of a future
world. Every reader of Scripture will acknowledge that the
unbelief which our Saviour menaces, is unbelief in his Gospel,
as preached by his Apostles, and confirmed by visible miracles;&mdash;it
is a rejection of Christianity. From this it would
seem clear, that no form under which the religion of Christ is
professed, however erroneous it may be, can be comprised
within the sentence of condemnation. But the argument of
the exclusionist is this:&mdash;My own system is, in my view, the
only one that is identical with the Gospel; therefore I must
believe that those who reject my system are exposed to the
penalties annexed to the rejection of the Gospel. It is surprising
that so many should fail to detect the fallacy of this
reasoning. Compare the case which our Saviour is supposing
with that of the man who, in preferring one profession of
Christianity, rejects all others; and you will find that there
are two most momentous points of distinction,&mdash;the motive of
the rejecter is different, and the thing rejected is different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>What can be more obvious, than that our Saviour refers to
the hearer's <i>intentional</i> rejection of the Gospel,&mdash;a rejection
of <i>his own</i> Christianity, not of his neighbor's. When punishment
is held forth as the consequence of any act, is it not always
implied that the act must be intentional? Is it not an
understood principle of every law, human and divine, that a
deed of accident and inadvertence is exempted from the penalties
which, were it designed, it would deserve? To condemn
for murder the man who through mistake should administer
a poisonous draught for a restorative, would be as just as
to put the erring believer and the wilful unbeliever on the
same level. To charge this enormous immorality on God,
would be the height of impiety. Widely as the professing
Christian may err, remote as his faith may be from the truth
as it is in Jesus, his intent is to believe; he yields his assent,
no less heartily than his wiser brother, to the evidence which
God has placed before him; he only mistakes what it is
which that evidence proves; he reverences, no less than
others, the authority which Jesus claims; but he does not discern
all the truths which that authority establishes. Strange
would it be, brethren, if God, who in all other cases looketh
at the heart, should in this look at the understanding
only.</p>

<p>But perhaps it will be urged that the same perversion of
mind which Jesus condemns is displayed by the modern inquirer,
who does not discern in the Gospel the great essentials
of Christianity; that his disbelief in them, in short, is not
wholly involuntary. A few words to this objection.</p>

<p>I admit that faith is a compound result of the will and the
understanding; connected indeed most obviously with the latter,
but determined more remotely by causes having their seat
in the former. In the process of investigation, the last step,
of weighing arguments and making up the mind, is undoubtedly
involuntary. When the evidence is once placed before
the inquirer, no energy of will can repel the conclusion which
is forced upon the judgment. When, however, we perceive
that the very same reasoning produces different results on different
persons, that one man is forcibly impressed by an argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
which to another appears weak and worthless, it becomes
necessary to account for these varieties in the effects of
evidence. And there can be no doubt that the perception of
truth is very materially influenced by the moral condition of
the mind. How powerful are the arguments in favor of the
Gospel derived from the moral beauty and symmetry of the
system, from the originality and loftiness of our Saviour's
character, from the adaptation of his religion to the wants of
the human mind under all its countless varieties! And yet
this species of evidence will be wholly without effect on those
whose minds are destitute of moral sensibility and refinement.
Moreover, it is notorious that the sanguine are always apt to
believe what they hope, the timid what they fear; and the
hopes and fears of conscience will exert this influence on belief
no less than any other. Prejudice which might be conquered,
indolence which ought to be shaken off, passions
which blind and corrupt the judgment, uneasy conscience
which alienates the desires from God, all these may exercise
a powerful moral sway over the faith; and for the influence
of these every man is certainly accountable.</p>

<p>But at the same time there is no reason to doubt that God
has created us with intellectual differences which are wholly
involuntary, and which must tend to fix the determinations of
the judgment. There are some men who, from their earliest
years, seem incapable of admitting a truth without double the
evidence with which others would be satisfied. Who then
among us is to determine what mind is most correctly strung?
Is the man who admits a proposition on one degree of evidence
to condemn his brother who requires two? And is it
credible that God will accept of none but him whom he has
himself placed at the only true point in the gradation? Impossible!
As well might we say that his heaven is closed
against the insane or the deformed.</p>

<p>It appears then, my friends, that belief flows from causes
partly moral, partly intellectual. But can any human eye, I
ask, discern in what proportion they are mingled in any one's
faith? Dare you say of your differing brother, that he differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
from a prevailing depravity of heart, and not from constitutional
causes? If not, then is there no human tribunal to
which opinion may be called. We are not forbidden to love
any fellow-creature, however remote his views from ours. As
we are unable to discover how far diversities of sentiment flow
from the will, we are bound to treat them all as if they were
entirely involuntary, and to leave to the Searcher of hearts
the award of approbation or displeasure.</p>

<p>Again, the faith rejected in the case which our Lord condemns,
is not the same that is renounced by the erring Christian.
What is the Christianity, the disbelief of which is pronounced
by Jesus to be so dangerous? Is it the Christianity
of Luther, of Calvin, of Arius, of Wesley? No, but the
Christianity of the Apostles, which they were "to preach to
every creature." Now in <i>this</i> all professing Christians believe;
and from it they derive those views which, when once
severed from their origin and entering the province of human
reason, so rapidly diverge from each other. It is in vain to
urge that <i>all</i> these systems, contradictory as they are, cannot
coincide with revelation; and that there must, therefore, be
some that do not constitute Christianity. The Gospel itself,
considered as a revelation, bears the same relation to all the
rival creeds whose credit hangs on its authority; like the beam
of the balance, which determines the scale neither way. Let
me not be mistaken, my friends. I mean not to say that all
systems of Christian faith are equally true, or equally accordant
with the sacred writings; but that their relative truth is
undetermined by the authority of revelation, and dependent
on the correctness of the reasoning by which they are deduced
from Scripture. All begin with reverencing the Gospel; and
this screens them from our Saviour's condemnation. They
then employ themselves in reasoning on the sacred writings
that lie before them; and if they then separate from each
other, it is through the same fallibility of mind which multiplies
opinions on other subjects, and for which assuredly God
will bring no man into judgment. The various systems of
Christian faith are but the diverging streams which flow from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the fountain of living waters: some may take a straighter,
others a more devious way; some may receive a scantier,
others a more copious admixture from a different source; some
may roll over a purer, others over a fouler bed; but <i>all</i> contain
the healing current which gushed from the smitten rock,
and all, I doubt not, are bearing onwards to meet at last in the
ocean of eternal rest.</p>

<p>Why then, my brethren, must we be handling terrors which
it is not ours to distribute, and sending forth into the dark
these fearful guesses at judgment? Why must our feeble
hand be playing with the lightning, and letting loose the hurricane?
Rather let us imitate God. Does he brand the heretic
with his curse? Does he pour the elements in fury
around his dwelling? Does he set a mark on him, that any
one finding him may slay him? See, the sunshine still smiles
upon his roof; the shower still refreshes his field; the charities
and hopes of life are still poured upon his heart. And
cannot we cheer with our human love the creature whom our
Father disdaineth not to bless? Are we so sinless as to stand
apart in our holiness from the being with whom the Majesty
of heaven can condescend to dwell, whom Infinite Purity stoops
to cherish? At least let us wait for the disclosure of those
secret counsels which we dare to scan. It will be time
enough to hate when God condemns, to shun when God driveth
away. Be assured, my brethren, no soul ever perished
for too much charity. "Be ye therefore perfect, as your
Father in heaven is perfect."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>III. It is the duty of every Christian in an age of controversy
to make an open, undisguised statement of his opinions,
and of the evidence which satisfies him of their truth. How
seldom do you see that union of courage and charity which
the spirit of the Gospel should impart! Here you find one
who discovers nothing in the religion of his brethren but
errors to controvert; who cannot perceive any Christianity
beyond the peculiarities of his own creed, and thinks that all
the evils of society are to be traced to the opinions of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
he has discerned the fallacy. There, on the other hand, is one
who, without perceiving the difference between discussion and
wrangling, entertains a foolish dread of all controversy, and,
as if the mutual good-will of mankind depended on their uniformity
of faith, suppresses his own views, and melts down
the distinctions which separate them from the views of others.
The enlightened Christian will acknowledge that both these
are in the extreme. Against the exclusive spirit of the former
the preceding part of this discourse may be a sufficient
remonstrance; and I will conclude with a few remarks in reference
to the latter. It must be admitted that the fear of
making an open profession of faith is a not unnatural fruit of
the despotism with which society persecutes those who deviate
from its established modes of thinking. A vast machinery of
refined intimidation is prepared, to awe down every rising
spirit that seeks to emerge from the thraldom of authorized
custom into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. The
charge of singularity, the smile of wonder, the sneer of aristocratical
derision, the cold recoil of suspicion, and the open
upbraidings of bigotry, are the keen weapons by which the
world hastens to assault the conscientious openness which it
ought to hail and venerate. Assailed by so many enemies, it
is little wonder that the weak and timid should fall into that
"fear of man which bringeth a snare"; and that this should
often lead them to act where they should keep aloof, and to
be passive where they should act; to speak when they should
be silent, and oftener to be silent when they should speak; to
think within the barriers of established rules, or, when more
convenient, not to think at all. But however natural may be
the origin of this accommodating flexibility in the intolerance
of society, it receives no justification hence; it is utterly incompatible
with that Christian simplicity which is ever the
same to men and to God, which unfolds the character to the
view in harmonious proportion, and would scorn to appear
other than it is. It can exist only in the mind that loves the
praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot leave this concluding part of my subject, without
remembering that I am animadverting on a fault which has
been peculiarly charged on my own sacred profession. The
ministers of the Gospel, it has been said, the very men who
should live under the constant eye of God, have ever afforded
the most signal examples of the fear of man. My brethren,
I confess it with shame: and it is a truth to which I can
never revert without feelings of indignant sorrow. Happily
there have been many noble exceptions, and in this place it
is not difficult to bring many before the view. But the more
I read the past records of the Church, and the more I study
its secret history at the present day, the more painfully strong
is my conviction that the ministers of the Gospel have been
the most temporizing class of men. They are the appointed
investigators of sacred truth, employed expressly for the purpose
of opening the treasuries of divine wisdom and knowledge;
and yet from none has society gained fewer accessions
of truth and light. Though stationed by their office between
heaven and earth, they have gathered upon their souls more
influences from below than from above; though ordained to
declare the whole counsel of God, they have more often
studied the taste than the wants of their hearers; though encircled
in the discharge of their duties by an arm almighty to
uphold, they too have felt afraid. My beloved friends, I know
not how it appears to others, but to me it seems that in the
whole Christian code there is not a duty of more clear and
paramount obligation than the honest, simple avowal of Christian
truth. The first natural dictate of the mind is to speak
what it thinks on any subject of deep interest and importance;
and I am persuaded that a man must sophisticate his conscience,
must fill his judgment with forced reasoning and false
excuses, before he can come to the conclusion that he had better
keep truth to himself. Do you ask me, "What is truth?
Amid the conflicting sentiments of mankind, how is it possible
with confidence to take up any as exclusively just?" I
answer, every man's own convictions to him are truth, to him
are Christianity; and that to conceal them is to act the part
of the wicked and slothful servant who buried his master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
talent in the earth. It signifies not that men may obtain acceptance
with God without thinking as you think; God forbid
that I should for a moment doubt that! But do you believe
that truth is better for man than error? Do you believe
that they are not both alike to his mental and moral condition?
If so, it is selfishness, it is sinful exclusion, to wrap
yourself up in the solitary enjoyment of your own convictions.
For my part, I see nothing but hypocrisy in the elaborate attempts
which are sometimes put forth, to make opinions look
like popular creeds, by slurring over grand points of distinction,
by pushing forward apparent resemblances, by a dexterous
use of ambiguous phrases, and other arts equally worthy
of a Christian's scorn. Indeed, my fellow-Christians, we
ought never to be content till this great principle has been
established,&mdash;that, in obeying the noble law of Christian openness
and sincerity, it is not the business of the human being
to calculate consequences <i>at all</i>; that temporal expediency
must in no degree enter into the consideration. God is the
author of truth, and he will take care of its consequences;
and I am well satisfied that, let appearances be what they
may, honesty will bring after it nothing but good. Even suppose
that we should be found to be in error: then, the sooner
it is exposed the better; and nothing is so likely to lead to
its exposure as the undisguised publication of its evidence.
"Opinion in good men," it has been beautifully remarked, "is
but knowledge in the making"; and it is by sifting the grounds
on which opinions rest, by bringing them into close comparison,
and setting many minds to work upon them, that truth is
at length elicited; and he is no enlightened lover of truth,
who is an enemy to the avowal of opinion. It is to be lamented
that the world has been so successful in circulating
the feeling, even among the well-meaning of mankind, that
there can be anything to be ashamed of in opinion; for hence
has arisen an association of fear, and almost of conscious guilt,
with one of the noblest and first duties of the mind, the duty
of thinking for itself. Let the inquirer and the teacher keep
their eye steadily fixed upon the Scriptures, make it their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
single object to know and to communicate what they contain;
let them utterly forget that there are any inspectors of their
conduct, any listeners to their words, except God and their
own conscience; and I am satisfied that truth and charity will
spread together, and more union be produced among the now
widely dissevered portions of the Christian world, than any
timid mediators, striving to be all things to all men, will ever
be able to effect. The alarmed reconciler of inconsistencies
may seem for a while to be successful; he may keep together
in temporary harmony those dissimilar elements which more
fearless spirits might separate; he may persuade men that
they agree when they are wide as the poles asunder;
he may surround himself by numbers, and multiply the directions
in which his immediate influence extends. On the
other hand, the reformer who cannot conceal, and who dare
not pretend, who interprets most strictly the law of Christian
simplicity, may lose many supporters who ought to stand by
him in the hour of trial; he may be looked on with suspicion
and avoided as dangerous; he may be the centre at which a
thousand weapons are directed; he may seem to have been
imprudent and premature, and to have baffled his own cause
by his indiscreet openness; he may go down to the evening
termination of his labors, accompanied only by a faithful few,
and cheered by no multitude of approving voices. But wait
till a generation has passed away, and then come and look
into the field occupied by these two laborers. Then you will
find it proved that numbers are not always strength; when
gathered together by the feeble bond of private influence,
they are scattered when that influence is withdrawn. The
timid man has left no permanent trace behind him; he has
inspired no courage, provided no security for the future, and
the grass has grown over the road that leads to his temple.
But the man who has not feared to tell the whole truth is
remembered and appealed to by succeeding generations; his
name, pronounced in his lifetime with reproach, becomes a
familiar term of encouragement; his thoughts, his spirit, long
survive him, gather together new and more powerful advocates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
and are associated with the records of imperishable
truth.</p>

<p>Finally, the great evil of this disposition is, that it constrains
the natural action of the mind, and produces a weak
vacillation of character which paralyzes every virtuous energy.
The grand secret of human power, my friends, is singleness
of purpose; before it, perils, opposition, and difficulty
melt away, and open out a certain pathway to success. But
alas! brethren, our Christianity has not taken from us the
spirit of fear, and given us in its place the spirit of power,
and of love, and of a sound mind. We still put duty to the
vote. We shrink from being singular, even in excellence,
forgetting how many things are customs in heaven which
are eccentricities on earth. We fix our eye, now on the
tempting treasures below, then on the half-veiled glories
above; we open our ears, now to the welcome tones of human
praise, then to the accents of God's approving voice; and in
the vain attempt to reconcile opposing claims, we sacrifice our
interest in both worlds. It is melancholy to think what a
waste of human activity has been occasioned by this weakness;
how many purposes which, if concentrated, might have left
deep traces of good, have been applied in opposite directions;
how many well-meaning men have laid a benumbing hand of
timidity on their own good deeds, and passed through life
without leaving one permanent impression of their character
on society. It is not want of an ample sphere, it is not poverty
of means, it is not mediocrity of talent, that makes most
men so inefficient in the world; it is a want of singleness of
aim. Let them keep a steady eye fixed on the great ends of
existence; let them bear straight onwards, never stepping
aside to consult the deceitful oracle of human opinion; let
them heed no spectators save that heavenly cloud of witnesses
that stand gazing from above; let them go forth into the
struggles of life armed with the assurance, "Fear not, for I
am with you";&mdash;and each man will be equal to a thousand;
all will give way before him; he will scatter renovating principles
of moral health; he will draw forth from a multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
other minds a mighty mass of kindred and once latent energy;
and, having imparted to others ennobled conceptions of the
purposes of life, will enter the unfolded gates of immortality,
breathing already its spirit of sublimity and joy. Brethren,
"how long shall we halt between two opinions?"</p>

hardly comports with the traditional dignity of the Anglican gentleman
and scholar. We remember an incident which occurred in a village
situated among the hills of one of our northern dioceses. On a fine summer
evening we had gone, at the close of the afternoon service, for a stroll
through the fields overlooking the valley. When we had walked half a mile
or so, an extraordinary din arose from the direction of the village, sounding
like nothing human or instrumental, larynx, catgut, or brass, though occasionally
mingled with an undeniable note from some shouting Stentor. It
was evident, through the trees, that a crowd was collected on the village green;
and not less so, that a farmer and his wife, who were looking on from a stile
hard by, understood the meaning of the scene below. On asking what all
the hubbub was about, we were told by the good woman: "It's all of our parson, that's banging out the Methody wi' the tae-board." Being curious
in ecclesiastical researches, we hastened down the hill, in spite of the
repulsion of increasing noise. On one side of the green was a deal table,
from which a field-preacher was holding forth with passionate but fruitless
energy; for on the other side, and at the back of the crowd, was the parochial
man of God, who had issued from his parsonage, armed with its largest
tea-tray and the hall-door key, and was battering off the Japan in the service
of orthodoxy. No military music could more effectually neutralize the
shrieks of battle. The more the evangelist bellowed, the faster went the
parish gong. It was impossible to confute such a "drum ecclesiastic."
The man was not easily put down; but the triumph was complete; and the
"Methody's" brass was fairly beaten out of the field by the Churchman's
tin.</p>

says: "This is an office assigned to none under the Gospel scheme, except
the <span class="smcap">one</span> great High-Priest, of whom the Jewish priests were types." (Elements
of Logic. Appendix: Note on the word "Priest.") Of the "<i>Gospel
scheme</i>" this is quite true; of the <i>Church-of-England scheme</i> it is not.
There lies before me Duport's Greek version of the Prayer-Book and Offices
of the Anglican Church: and turning to the Communion Service, I find the
officiating clergyman called ἱερευς throughout. The <i>absence</i> of this word
from the records of the primitive Gospel, and its <i>presence</i> in the Prayer-Book,
is perfectly expressive of the difference in the spirit of the two systems;&mdash;the
difference between the Church <i>with</i>, and the "Christianity <i>without</i>
Priest."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See Rom. vi. 2-4: "How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into
Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with
him by baptism into death; that, like as Christ was raised up from the dead
by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
Mr. Locke observes of "St. Paul's argument," that it "is to show in what
state of life we ought to be raised out of baptism, in similitude and conformity
to that state of life Christ was raised into from the grave." See also
Col. ii. 12: "Ye are ... buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are
risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised
him from the dead." The force of the image clearly depends on the sinking
and rising in the water.</p>

in order to continue true; or he must show no truth, in order to exercise
mercy. If he overlook man's guilt, <i>admit him to the enjoyment of his favor,
and proceed</i> by corrective discipline to restore his character, he unsettles the
foundations of all equitable government, obliterates the everlasting distinctions
between right and wrong, spreads consternation in heaven, and proclaims
impunity in hell. Such a God would not be worth serving. <i>Such</i>
tenderness, instead of inspiring filial affection, would lead only to reckless
contempt."&mdash;<i>Mr. M'Neile's Lecture</i>, p. 313.
</p>
<p>
Surely this is a description, not of the Unitarian, but of the Lecturer's
own creed. It certainly is no part of his opponents' belief, that God
first admits the guilty to his favor, and <i>then "proceeds"</i> "to restore his
character." This arrangement, by which pardon <i>precedes</i> moral restoration,
is that feature in the Orthodox theory of the Divine dealings against which
Unitarians protest, and which Mr. M'Neile himself insists upon as essential
throughout his Lecture. "We think," he says, "that <i>before</i> man can be
introduced to the only true process of improvement, he must <i>first</i> have forgiveness
of his guilt." What is this "first" step, of pardon, but an "overlooking
of man's guilt"; and what is the second, of "sanctification," but a
"restoring of character"; whether we say by "corrective discipline," or
the "influence of the Holy Spirit," matters not. Is it said that the guilt is
not overlooked, if Christ endured its penalty? I ask, again, whether justice regards only the <i>infliction</i> of suffering, or its <i>quantity</i>, without caring about
its <i>direction</i>? Was it impossible for the stern righteousness of God freely to
forgive the penitent? And how was the injustice of liberating the guilty
mended by the torments of the innocent? Here is the verdict against sin:
"The soul that sinneth, it shall die." And how is this verdict executed?
The soul that had sinned does <i>not</i> die; and one "that knew no sin" dies
instead. And this is called a divine union of <i>truth</i> and <i>mercy</i>; being the
most precise negation of both, of which any conception can be formed.
First, to hang the destinies of all mankind upon a solitary volition of their
first parents, and then let loose a diabolic power on that volition to break it
down; to vitiate the human constitution in punishment for the fall, and yet
continue to demand obedience to the original and perfect moral law; to
assert the absolute inflexibility of that holy law, yet all the while have in
view for the offenders a method of escape, which violates every one of its
provisions, and makes it all a solemn pretence; to forgive that which is in
itself unpardonable, on condition of the suicide of a God, is to shock and
confound all notions of rectitude, without affording even the sublimity of a
savage grandeur. This will be called "blasphemy"; and it is so; but the
blasphemy is not in the <i>words</i>, but in the <i>thing</i>.
</p>
<p>
Unitarians are falsely accused of representing God as "overlooking man's
guilt." They hold, that <i>no guilt is overlooked till it is eradicated from the
soul</i>; and that pardon proceeds <i>pari passu</i> with sanctification.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Mr. Buddicom has the following note, intimating his approbation of this
rendering: "Some of the best commentators have connected εν τω αυτου
αιματι, not with δια της πιστεως, but with ἱλαστηριον and, accordingly,
Bishop Bull renders the passage, 'Quem proposuit Deus placamentum in
sanguine suo per fidem.'"&mdash;<i>Lecture on Atonement</i>, p. 496.</p>

the Gentiles, see Rom. xi. 12-15; where St. Paul, speaking of the rejection
of the Messiah by the Jews, declares that it is only temporary; and as it has
given occasion for the adoption of the Gentiles, so will this lead, by ultimate
reaction, to the readmission of Israel; a consummation in which the Gentiles should rejoice without boasting or high-mindedness. "If," he says, "the fall
of them (the Israelites) be the riches of <i>the world</i> (the Gentiles), and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness!
For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles,
I magnify my office; if, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them
which are my flesh (the Jews), and save some of them; for if the casting
away of them be the <i>reconciling of the world</i>, what shall the receiving of
them be but life from the dead?"</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> In three or four instances, it is true, a sin-offering is demanded from the
perpetrator of some act of <i>moral wrong</i>. But in all these cases a suitable
punishment was ordained also; a circumstance inconsistent with the idea,
that the expiation procured remission of guilt. The <i>sacrifice</i> appended to
the <i>penal infliction</i> indicates the twofold character of the act,&mdash;at once a
<i>ceremonial defilement</i> and a <i>crime</i>; and requiring, to remedy the one, an
atoning rite,&mdash;to chastise the other, a judicial penalty. See an excellent
tract by Rev. Edward Higginson, of Hull, entitled, "The Sacrifice of Christ
scripturally and rationally interpreted," particularly pp. 30-34.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Heb. vii. 27. Let the reader look carefully again into the verbal and
logical structure of this verse; and then ask himself whether it is not as
plain as words can make it, that Christ "once for all" <i>offered up</i> "<i>a sacrifice
first for</i> <span class="smcap">his own sins</span>, and <i>then for the people's</i>." The argument surely is
this: "He need not do the <i>daily</i> thing, for he has done it <i>once for all</i>; the
never-finished work of other pontiffs, a single act of his achieved." The
sentiment loses its meaning, unless that which he did once is <i>the selfsame
thing</i> which they did always: and what was that?&mdash;the offering by the high-priest of a sacrifice first for his own sins, and then for the people's.
With what propriety, then, can Mr. Buddicom ask us this question: "Why
is he said to have excelled the Jewish high-priest in <i>not</i> offering a sacrifice
for himself?" I submit, that no such thing is said; but that, on the contrary,
it is positively affirmed that Christ <i>did</i> offer sacrifice for his own sins.
So plain indeed is this, that Trinitarian commentators are forced to slip in a
restraining word and an additional sentiment into the last clause of the verse.
Thus Pierce: "Who has no need, like the priests under the law, from time
to time to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins, and after that for the people's.
For this <i>latter</i> he did once for all when he offered up himself; <i>and as
to the former, he had no occasion to do it at all</i>." And no doubt the writer of
the Epistle <i>ought</i> to have said just this, if he intended to draw the kind of
contrast which orthodox theology requires, between Jesus and the Hebrew
priests. He limits the opposition between them to <i>one</i> particular;&mdash;the Son
of Aaron made offering <i>daily</i>,&mdash;the Son of God <i>once for all</i>. Divines must
add <i>another</i> particular;&mdash;that the Jewish priest atoned for <i>two</i> classes of sins,
his own and the people's,&mdash;Christ for the people's only. Suppose for a moment
that this was the author's design; that the word "<i>this</i>," instead of having
its proper grammatical antecedent, may be restrained, as in the commentary
cited above, to the sacrifice for <i>the people's</i> sins; then the word "daily"
may be left out, without disturbance to the other substantive particular of
the contrast: the verse will then stand thus: "Who needeth not, as those
high-priests, to offer up sacrifice for his own sins; <i>for</i> he offered up sacrifice
for the people's sins, when he offered up himself." Here, all the reasoning
is obviously gone, and the sentence becomes a mere inanity: to make sense,
we want, instead of the latter clause, the sentiment of Pierce,&mdash;<i>for</i> "he had
no occasion to do this at all." This, however, is an invention of the expositor, more jealous for his author's orthodoxy than for his composition. I think
it necessary to add, that, by leaving out the most emphatic word in this
verse (the word <i>once</i>) Mr. Buddicom has suppressed the author's antithesis,
and favored the suggestion of his own. I have no doubt that this was unconsciously
done; but it shows how system rubs off the angles of Scriptural
difficulties.&mdash;I subjoin a part of the note of John Crell on the passage: "De
pontifice Christo loquitur. Quid verô fecit semel Christus? quid aliud,
quam quod Pontifex antiquus statâ die quotannis<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> faciebat? Principaliter
autem hic non de oblatione pro peccatis populi; sed de oblatione pro ipsius
Pontificis peccatis agi, ex superioribus, ipsoque rationum contextu manifestum
est."
</p>
<p>
The sins which his sacrifice cancelled must have been of the same order in
the people and in himself; certainly therefore not moral in their character,
but ceremonial. His death was, for himself no less than for his Hebrew disciples,
a commutation for the Mosaic ordinances. Had he not died, he must
have continued under their power; "were he on earth, he would not be a
priest," or have "obtained that more excellent ministry," by which he clears
away, in the courts above, all possibilities of ritual sin below, and himself
emerges from legal to spiritual relations.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Perhaps we should rather say, "they cannot be alien to our nature."
The word <i>personality</i> is used by philosophical writers to denote that
which is <i>peculiar</i>, as well as essential, to our individual self. In this strict
sense the moral and spiritual affections are <i>impersonal</i>, according to the doctrine
of the context, which treats them as constituting a participation in the
Divine nature. The metaphysical reader will perhaps perceive here a resemblance
to the theory of Victor Cousin, who maintains that the <i>will&mdash;the
free and voluntary activity</i>&mdash;of the human being is the specific faculty in
which alone consists his <i>personality</i>; and that the intuitive reason by
which we have knowledge of the unlimited and absolute Cause, as well as
of ourselves and the universe as related effects, is independent and impersonal,&mdash;a
faculty not peculiar to the subject, but "from the bosom of consciousness
extending to the Infinite, and reaching to the Being of beings."
"Reason," observes this philosopher, "is intimately connected with personality
and sensibility, but it is neither the one nor the other: and precisely
because it is neither the one nor the other, because it is in us without being ourselves, does it reveal to us that which is not ourselves,&mdash;objects beside
the subject itself, and which lie beyond its sphere." At the opposite pole to
this doctrine, which makes the perceptions of "Reason" a part of the activity
of God, lies the system of Kant and Fichte, which represents God as
an ideal formation,&mdash;it may be, therefore, a <i>fiction</i>,&mdash;arising from the activity
of the "Reason." This faculty is treated by these German philosophers
as merely <i>subjective and personal</i>; its perceptions, even when they
seem to go beyond itself, are known only as internal conditions and results
of self-activity; its beliefs, though inevitable to itself, are simply relative,
and have no objective validity. The faiths and affections which this system
regards as purely human, are considered by the other as divine. The doctrine
maintained above, though resembling that of Kant in one or two of
its phrases, far more nearly approaches that of Cousin in its spirit. It is
scarcely necessary to observe that, in this note, the word "Reason" is used,
not as equivalent to "Understanding," but in the German sense so long rendered
familiar to the English reader by the writings of Mr. Coleridge. It
includes, therefore, (in its two senses of "<i>Speculative</i>" and "<i>Practical</i>,") the
"Moral Perceptions" and "Primitive Faiths of the Conscience," spoken of
in the text.</p>

pleasures of sense. And with wilful misguidance he says, setting himself in opposition to the Scriptures of God, that a period of a thousand years will be
spent in nuptial festivities." On this much-controverted passage, Lardner
(Cred., P. II. ch. xxxii.) suspends his judgment, rather inclining to doubt
whether our Apocalypse is referred to; Hug (Einl. § 176), Paulus (Hist.
Cerinth., P. I. § 30), with Twells and Hartwig (whose criticisms we have not
seen), deny that the Apocalypse is meant; while Eichhorn (Einl. in das
N. T., VI. v. § 194. 2), De Wette (Lehrbuch der Einl. in d. N. T., § 192 a),
Lücke (Commentar üb. d. Schriften des Ev. Johannes, Offenb. § 33), and
Schwegler (Das nachapost. Zeitalter, 2er B. p. 218), take the other side. It
must be confessed also, that, till the rise of the present discussion about the
"Philosophoumena," Baur agreed with these last writers. (See his Christl.
Lehre v. d. Dreieinigkeit, 1er B. p. 283.) He now urges, however, that, in a
case already so doubtful, the discovery of a lost book, which we have good
reason to ascribe to Caius, necessarily brings in new evidence, and may turn
the scale between two balanced interpretations. (Theol. Jahrb., p. 157.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Baur explains the slight treatment of the Montanist heresy in the
"Philosophumena" by the intention which Caius already had of writing a
special book against them: and contends that this intention is announced
expressly in the words (p. 276), περι τουτων αυθις λεπτομερεστερον εκθησομαι ·
πολλοις γαρ αφορμη κακων γεγενηται ἡ τουτων αιρεσις. These
words, however, do not refer, as the connection evidently shows, to the Montanists
generally; but only to a certain class of them who fell in with the
patripassian doctrine of Noctus. The Noctian scheme Caius was going to
discuss further on in this very book: and it is evidently to this later chapter,
not to any separate work against Montanism, that he alludes.</p>

their view with Sabellianism. See Dorner's "Entwickelungsgeschichte der

for attributing to "the whole school of Tübingen" the opinion "that the
fourth Gospel was written about the year 165 or 170." (I. v.) We cannot
call to mind any criticism which assigns so late a date. Schwegler uses
various expressions to mark the time to which he refers; e. g. "about the
middle of the second century" (Nachapost. Zeitalter, II. 354, and Montanismus,
p. 214); "intermediate between the Apologists and Irenæus" (II.
369); "previous to the last third of the second century" (II. 348); "in the
second quarter of the second century" (II. 345). Zeller also fixes on the year
150 as the time when the Gospel may probably have first appeared. (Zeller's
Jahrb., 1845, p. 646.)</p>

to either.

be light, and there was light," with its applications to John i. 9, proceeds
from "Basilides" or from "these men"?</p>

of Belief," who presents himself to us through the Cambridge publisher, is
really a University man? To those who are curious about such critical
problems, we would suggest this consideration, as having some bearing on
the case: "Could a person who had studied the laws of accelerated motion
at the authoritative school of English science have so forgotten his formulas
as to make his <i>heaviest</i> man on that account his <i>quickest</i>?" The authorship,
however, is not less evident than if the book had been published by Messrs.
Longmans, or by Holdsworth and Ball.</p>

We subjoin in this connection a just and striking remark of Mr. Jowett's. In inquiries of this sort, it is often supposed that, if the evidence of the genuineness
of a single book of Scripture be weakened, or the credit of a single
chapter shaken, a deep and irreparable injury is inflicted on Christian truth,
and may afford a rest to the mind to consider that, if but one discourse of
Christ, one Epistle of Paul, had come down to us, still more than half would
have been preserved. Coleridge has remarked, that out of a single play of
Shakespeare the whole of English literature might be restored. Much more
true is it that in short portions or single verses of Scripture the whole spirit
of Christianity is contained. Vol. I. p. 352.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> Was it in reference to this mere <i>family-title</i> to a <i>spiritual</i> authority that
Paul says of the Jerusalem Apostles, "Whatever they were, it maketh no
matter to me; God accepteth <i>no man's person</i>"? (Gal. iii. 6.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> In proof of an essential unity of teaching, Mr. Jowett quotes Paul as
declaring that what they preached against him was "<i>not another</i>" gospel,
"for there was not, could not, be another." (I. 340.) But far from bearing
this conciliatory turn, which is out of character with the whole context,
Gal. i. 6 affirms that what his opponents have been preaching <i>is</i> (1.)
another gospel; and yet (2.) <i>not</i> another gospel, (not so good even as that,)
but mere disturbance and perversion, the negation of a gospel.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Compare also Rom. xiv. 10; Phil. i. 6; 2 Tim. iv. 1. Nay, the very passage
in which he renounces the "knowing of Christ according to the flesh,"
contains the doctrine (2 Cor. v. 10).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> With a curious inconsistency Mr. Stanley fixes <i>at the Apostle's conversion</i>
the date after which he would no longer "know Christ according to the
flesh"; yet in the very next note declares, that this state of mind must be
referred to a more recent period than the conversion.
</p>
<p>
"απο του νυν, from <i>the time of my conversion</i>." It is to be presumed that
this is also Mr. Stanley's interpretation of the νυν ουκετι of the next clause,
which only repeats specifically of "Christ" what has just been said universally.
</p>
<p>
"ει και εγνωκαμεν κατα σαρκα χριστον, even though I have known;
granting that I have known." γινωσκομεν, i. e. κατα σαρκα, "henceforth we know him no longer.... The words lead us to infer that something
of this kind had once been [prior, surely, to the "<i>henceforth</i>"] his own
state of mind, <i>not only</i> in the time before his conversion, ... <i>but since</i>!"
</p>
<p>
How then can the "<i>henceforth</i>" serve as the <i>terminus a quo</i>, if the same
state lies on both sides of it?</p>
